# Global steel industry navigates overcapacity and transformation challenges

The global steel industry produced **1,882.6 million tonnes** in 2024 while facing an existential crisis from massive overcapacity projected to reach **721 million tonnes by 2027**—exceeding all OECD production combined. China's **record 110.7 million tonne exports** in 2024 have triggered protective trade measures worldwide as the industry simultaneously confronts the costly imperative of decarbonization, with current **annual emissions of 3.7 billion tonnes CO₂** requiring fundamental technological transformation while profitability remains well below sustainable levels at just 8-10% EBITDA margins.

This perfect storm of challenges masks significant regional divergence. India's **8-9% annual growth** positions it as the fastest-growing major market while China enters structural decline from its property crisis. Japan leads in **hydrogen steelmaking technology** achieving **43% CO₂ reduction**, though Europe's ambitious green steel investments face indefinite postponement. The United States maintains **77% capacity utilization** behind **50% tariffs**, while African markets grow at 3-4% annually amid substantial Chinese investment. The industry's survival depends on coordinated capacity discipline, accelerated low-carbon technology deployment with adequate policy support, and strategic positioning in premium and growing market segments.

## Global overcapacity crisis threatens industry viability across all regions

Global steel capacity utilization declined below **75% in early 2025**, down from 77.3% in late 2024, creating severe profitability pressures. The OECD projects excess capacity will balloon from **602 million tonnes** currently to **721 million tonnes by 2027**—a staggering volume that exceeds total European Union production by 290 million tonnes. This structural overcapacity stems primarily from **China's 1.25-1.3 billion tonne capacity** against declining domestic demand that fell to a **six-year low of 892.87 million tonnes** in 2024 as the property sector crisis eliminated 45 million tonnes of construction steel demand.

The crisis intensified as **165 million tonnes of new capacity** is planned for 2025-2027, with **58% concentrated in Asia** and troublingly **40% still using high-emission blast furnace technology** despite decarbonization imperatives. China alone accounts for **134 million tonnes of potential additions**, though the government imposed a comprehensive **capacity replacement suspension in August 2024** to curb further expansion. Industry profitability has collapsed to unsustainable levels, with average **EBITDA margins of 8-10%** falling far short of the **15-17% threshold** needed for long-term viability and investment in green transitions.

China's response to weak domestic consumption has been to flood export markets, with 2024 shipments of **110.72 million tonnes** representing a **22.7% year-over-year increase** and surpassing the previous 2015 record. This export surge, coupled with pricing **10-20% below competitors** due to scale economies and state subsidies, has triggered **81 anti-dumping investigations** in 2024 alone—five times the 16 cases filed in 2023. Major markets have responded with aggressive protection measures: the United States imposed **50% tariffs**, Canada added **25% duties**, Turkey implemented **20.56-57.75% tariffs**, and Brazil extended quota systems covering 23 product categories.

## Decarbonization imperatives clash with economic realities and technology timelines

Steel production currently generates **3.7 billion tonnes of CO₂ annually**, representing **7% of global greenhouse gas emissions** with an intensity of **1.92 tonnes CO₂ per tonne of steel**. Alarmingly, emissions increased **more than 2%** between 2022-2023 despite widespread net-zero commitments, highlighting the gap between ambition and implementation. Only **20 of the top 50 producers** have adopted 2050 net-zero targets, while **50% lack any commitments** whatsoever, and five companies have deferred targets beyond 2060, representing **138 million tonnes per annum** of capacity with delayed action.

The industry invested **$7.4 billion** in decarbonization projects during 2024, with major commitments from SSAB, Baowu, Nucor, and POSCO, while government support reached unprecedented levels with **€15.1 billion in European subsidies**, **$1.5 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy**, and similar programs across Asia. These investments target **100 million tonnes per year** of low-emissions steel capacity by 2030, projected to grow to **200+ million tonnes** representing 10% of global production. However, reality has proven far more challenging than projections, with **ArcelorMittal postponing all European decarbonization investments indefinitely** in late 2024 citing unfavorable economics, absent green hydrogen supply, and insufficient market demand for premium-priced green steel.

Technology pathways present stark cost differentials that explain industry hesitation. Hydrogen-based direct reduced iron paired with electric arc furnaces (H2-DRI-EAF) offers **95% emissions reduction potential** but currently costs **79% more** than conventional blast furnace routes using green hydrogen at **€6-7 per kilogram**—far above the **€2/kg** needed for competitiveness. Natural gas-based DRI provides only **1.5-1.7 tonnes CO₂ per tonne steel** compared to **2.0 tonnes for blast furnaces**, offering marginal improvement at **18% cost premium**. Electric arc furnaces using scrap achieve **0.2-0.5 tonnes CO₂** emissions but face constraints from **finite scrap availability** and quality degradation from tramp elements like copper and tin.

China leads in scale with **10+ hydrogen-based DRI projects under construction** targeting over **10 million tonnes capacity by 2030**, including **HBIS Group's world-first industrial-scale facility** producing **600,000 tonnes annually** using **60%+ hydrogen** with emissions as low as **250 kg CO₂ per tonne DRI**. Baowu's Zhanjiang plant achieved **1 million tonnes per year** production starting December 2023. Japan's Super COURSE50 demonstration achieved a **world-record 43% CO₂ reduction** in December 2024 at Nippon Steel's Kimitsu facility, targeting commercial deployment exceeding **50% reduction by 2030**. Europe's **H2 Green Steel** project in Sweden progresses toward **2.5 million tonnes initially** expanding to **5 million tonnes by 2030** with **95% emissions reduction**, while Sweden's **HYBRIT** demonstration has delivered fossil-free steel commercially since 2021.

## Regional trade flows reshape as protectionism intensifies globally

Global steel trade reached approximately **435 million tonnes** in 2023, representing **25% of production** crossing borders, growing **3.3% in 2024** despite intensifying trade tensions. China dominates with **117.1 million tonnes exported** in 2024, followed by Japan at **31.2 million tonnes** (down 3.1%), South Korea at **28.0 million tonnes** (up 3.7%), and the European Union at **27.8 million tonnes** (up 6.9%). Major importers include the **European Union at 42.8 million tonnes**, the **United States at 27.3 million tonnes**, and **Turkey at 19.7 million tonnes**, with import penetration reaching historic highs in several markets.

The trade landscape transformed dramatically as protectionism escalated throughout 2024-2025. The United States doubled Section 232 tariffs to **50% in June 2025**, eliminating all country exemptions and later expanding coverage to **407+ derivative product codes**. Canada retaliated with **25% tariffs** on **C$15.6 billion** of U.S. steel and aluminum while simultaneously facing the American duties. The European Union proposed a **47% reduction in duty-free quotas** to **18.3 million tonnes annually** with tariff rates doubled from **25% to 50%** for over-quota volumes, scheduled to replace expiring safeguards in mid-2026.

Price differentials reveal the extent of trade distortions. Chinese **hot-rolled coil exports averaged $472 per tonne FOB** compared to India at **$507**, Turkey at **$540**, and U.S. domestic prices at **$800-815 per short ton** in October 2025—representing a **100%+ premium** over Chinese levels. These gaps reflect not only transportation costs and quality differences but fundamentally different production economics driven by energy costs, subsidies, and capacity utilization rates. European electricity prices at **€0.16/kWh** compare to **€0.07/kWh in the United States** and roughly **50% lower in China**, with natural gas prices nearly **five times U.S. levels**, creating structural cost disadvantages of **10-20%** for European producers.

Raw material markets exhibited relative stability compared to production chaos. Iron ore prices averaged **$105 per dry metric tonne** in 2024, declining to a forecast **$90/dmt in 2025** according to Fitch Ratings, with September 2025 spot prices at **$106/dmt** for 62% Fe content delivered to North China. Premium hard coking coal averaged **$240 per tonne** in 2024, declining to **$189/dmt** in September 2025 with projections of **$190/mt** for full-year 2025. Steel scrap markets remained oversupplied with **HMS 1&2 averaging ~$225 per ton**, though prices vary **$150-400/ton** depending on grade and location.

## China's dominance and decline create global ripple effects

China produced **1,005 million tonnes** of crude steel in 2024, representing **53% of global output** despite a **1.7% year-over-year decline**—the lowest production level in five years. This decrease reflects China's structural economic transition as the property sector crisis drove steel consumption down **4.8%** to **892.87 million tonnes**, a **six-year low**, with new housing starts plunging **28%** and eliminating approximately **45 million tonnes** of demand. Infrastructure spending failed to compensate for residential construction collapse, creating a persistent supply-demand imbalance that Chinese authorities addressed through a comprehensive **capacity replacement suspension** imposed in August 2024, prohibiting all new blast furnace additions and restricting regional capacity transfers.

China Baowu Steel Group dominates as the world's largest producer with approximately **130 million tonnes annually**—exceeding the entire production of most countries—followed by Angang Steel at **55-56 million tonnes**, HBIS Group at **42-44 million tonnes**, Shagang Group at **40-41 million tonnes**, and Shougang Group at **32-34 million tonnes**. The top ten producers increased market share from **42% to 48%** between 2018 and 2023, moving toward the government's **60% consolidation target by 2025**, though local protectionism continues impeding mergers as provincial authorities commonly bar steel from neighboring regions to protect local employment and tax bases.

The industry responded to weak domestic demand by redirecting production to exports, which reached an **all-time record 110.72 million tonnes** in 2024, up **22.7%** from 90.3 million tonnes in 2023, with particularly strong **58% absorption by ASEAN infrastructure projects**. First quarter 2025 maintained momentum at **27.4 million tonnes** (up 6.3%), though full-year forecasts project **96-100 million tonnes** as trade barriers take effect. Major destinations included Vietnam, South Korea, UAE, Thailand, and the Philippines, with Chinese hot-rolled coil priced at just **$472 per tonne FOB** compared to **$507 from India** and **$540 from Turkey**, creating enormous competitive pressure. This export surge triggered **29 major anti-dumping cases** filed against Chinese steel between early 2024 and February 2025, compared to just 15 cases during the entire 2020-2023 period.

China leads global green steel development with **10+ hydrogen-based DRI projects under construction** targeting over **10 million tonnes capacity by 2030** and total investments exceeding **$7 billion**. HBIS Group operates the **world's first industrial-scale hydrogen-enriched DRI facility** producing **600,000 tonnes annually** using **60%+ hydrogen** with CO₂ emissions as low as **250 kg per tonne DRI**—the world's lowest—and completed its first export shipment of **10,000+ tonnes to Italy** in July 2024. Baowu's Zhanjiang **zero-carbon demonstration plant** achieved **1 million tonnes per year** production starting December 2023, saving **500,000 tonnes CO₂ annually**. The government targets **100,000-200,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen by 2025**, achieving **2.5 GW electrolyzer capacity** by end-2024 (one year early), with projections of **$4/kg hydrogen cost by 2025** declining to **$2.40/kg by 2030**.

## Japan maintains technology leadership while confronting structural decline

Japanese steel production declined **3.4%** to **84.01 million tonnes** in 2024 from 87.0 million tonnes in 2023, continuing a three-year downward trajectory with **capacity utilization at just 68.6%** against **122.45 million tonnes nominal capacity**. The industry operates **20 blast furnaces**, of which **13 exceed 5,000 cubic meter capacity**, employing a production split of **73.8% blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace** and **26.2% electric arc furnace**. Domestic consumption fell **4.3%** to **49.66 million tonnes** in fiscal 2024 as the automotive sector struggled with certification fraud scandals, construction faced labor shortages, and the broader economy contracted **-0.2% GDP** amid persistent stagnation.

Nippon Steel dominates with revenue of **8.87 trillion yen** ($59 billion) in fiscal 2023, commanding the market alongside JFE Steel and Kobe Steel as the three major producers. Nippon Steel completed its controversial **$14.9 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel** in June 2025 after President Trump reversed President Biden's January 2025 national security block, imposing strict conditions including a **"golden share"** granting the U.S. government veto power over plant closures, headquarters moves, and major strategic decisions. The combined entity will possess **86 million tonnes annual capacity**, providing critical access to the North American market and avoiding newly-doubled **50% U.S. tariffs**. Domestically, Nippon Steel plans massive EAF conversions at Kyushu Yawata, Setouchi Hirohata, and Yamaguchi facilities requiring approximately **¥870 billion investment**.

Japan achieved unparalleled technological breakthroughs in hydrogen steelmaking through the Super COURSE50 program, with Nippon Steel's demonstration facility achieving a **world-record 43% CO₂ reduction** in December 2024 at its Kimitsu facility, becoming the first globally to exceed 40% reduction in operational conditions. The program received doubled government funding of **449.9 billion yen** (up from initial 193.5 billion) targeting **50%+ reduction by 2030** in commercial operations through hydrogen injection into existing blast furnaces. Parallel development of **hydrogen direct reduction technology** targets production exceeding **100 tonnes per hour from low-grade ore** with a demonstration facility planned for **2030 at one-fifth scale** of conventional blast furnaces requiring approximately **40 billion yen investment** (60% government-funded).

Japanese electrical steel production positions the industry as global leader for EV traction motors and wind turbine applications, with Nippon Steel investing **213 billion yen cumulatively** across Hirohata, Sakai, and Yawata facilities while JFE **doubled capacity in July 2024** with Phase II targeting **triple capacity by fiscal 2026** at Kurashiki. JFE's **approved large innovative EAF** becoming operational in fiscal 2027 represents the **world's first mass production of high-grade steel in large electric arc furnaces** using proprietary melting technology. Japan exported **31.71 million tonnes** in 2024 (down 3.0%), with major destinations including South Korea at **4.78 million tonnes**, Thailand at **4.28 million tonnes**, and China at **2.67 million tonnes**, though export competitiveness eroded from doubled U.S. tariffs and intensifying Chinese competition.

## India emerges as fastest-growing major market with aggressive expansion

India produced **151.14 million tonnes** crude steel in fiscal 2025 (ending March 2025) with finished steel production at **145.30 million tonnes**, achieving **8% growth** and solidifying its position as the **world's second-largest producer** after China. Production capacity expanded dramatically to **200.33 million tonnes**, representing a **10% increase** from 186 million tonnes in fiscal 2024 and nearly doubling from 109 million tonnes in 2015. The government's National Steel Policy targets **300 million tonnes capacity by 2030-31** requiring approximately **100 million tonnes of additions** and investment estimated at **₹10 lakh crore** ($156 billion), with near-term additions of **40 million tonnes annually** split **65% blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace** and **35% electric arc furnace**.

JSW Steel leads as India's largest steelmaker with current capacity of **29.5 million tonnes per annum**, targeting **38.2 million tonnes by fiscal 2025** and **51.5 million tonnes by 2030** through massive investments including **₹1 lakh crore** ($12 billion) for a **25 million tonne plant** in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra and **$7.8 billion** for a **13.2 million tonne facility** in Odisha. Tata Steel operates **21.6 million tonnes capacity** in India as part of its **35 million tonnes global capacity**, expanding Kalinganagar from **3 million tonnes to 8 million tonnes** while adding a **0.75 million tonne EAF plant** in Ludhiana for low-carbon steel. Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) maintains **21 million tonnes capacity** targeting **35 million tonnes by 2030** with **₹7,500 crore** ($875 million) approved for fiscal 2026, while AM/NS India (ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel joint venture) operates **9.6 million tonnes** at Hazira with a new **7 million tonne integrated mill** planned for Andhra Pradesh.

Domestic demand drives growth with **150.23 million tonnes** consumed in fiscal 2025, supported by the **National Infrastructure Pipeline** worth **₹100 trillion** ($1.3 trillion) encompassing Bharatmala highway projects, PM-AWAS housing schemes, Smart Cities Mission 2.0, and extensive metro construction. Per capita consumption reached **100 kg in fiscal 2026**, targeting **160 kg by fiscal 2031** as infrastructure and construction sectors provide sustained demand growth projected at **9-10% annually** according to industry estimates. Regional concentration centers on Odisha at **20.51% of production**, Chhattisgarh at **17.95%**, Gujarat at **5.13%**, and Andhra Pradesh at **6.41%**, leveraging proximity to iron ore deposits and port infrastructure.

India became a **net importer** for the second consecutive year in fiscal 2025 with **9.53 million tonnes imported** against **4.85 million tonnes exported**, though the gap narrowed substantially in early fiscal 2026 to near balance. The surge of **8.98 million tonnes imported** during April-February fiscal 2026 (up 15.8% year-over-year), predominantly **cheap Chinese steel**, prompted the government to impose a temporary **12% safeguard duty for 200 days** and launch the **Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS) 2.0** in July 2024 for real-time tracking. Major import sources included South Korea at **2.6 million tonnes**, China at **2.4 million tonnes**, and Japan at **1.9 million tonnes**, while exports reached **40+ countries** with UAE, United States, Mexico, Peru, and Europe accounting for significant volumes.

Government support accelerated through the **Production Linked Incentive scheme** for specialty steel with total outlay of **₹6,322 crore** ($733 million), attracting **₹27,106 crore commitments** in the first round and **₹17,000 crore from 25 companies** in the second round, targeting **7.9 million tonnes specialty steel capacity** and **15,000 jobs**. The **Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products policy** mandates preferential procurement with **15-50% value addition thresholds** for government tenders, while **100% FDI under automatic route** attracted **₹1,60,000 crore** ($18.67 billion) between April 2000 and June 2025. India launched a **green steel classification system** in December 2024 defining steel with **less than 2.2 tonnes CO₂ per tonne** as "green" and **less than 1.6 tonnes** receiving five-star rating, with demand forecast at **4.49 million tonnes by fiscal 2030** rising to **179 million tonnes by fiscal 2050**.

## South Korea balances advanced technology with export challenges

South Korean crude steel production reached approximately **62-64 million tonnes** in 2024 with monthly output ranging **5.0-5.2 million tonnes**, experiencing **slight declines of 1-3%** in most months year-over-year as the industry navigates weak regional demand and intensified Chinese competition. POSCO Holdings (formerly POSCO) dominates as the **world's seventh-largest producer** with **35.47 million tonnes** in 2024, representing approximately **56% of national production**, generating consolidated revenue of **KRW 72.69 trillion** ($50.88 billion) though operating profit declined **38.4%** to **KRW 2.17 trillion** from the previous year amid asset impairment losses totaling **KRW 1.2 trillion** for full-year 2024.

Hyundai Steel ranks as South Korea's **second-largest producer** and the **world's second-largest EAF steelmaker** after Nucor, with **18.69 million tonnes produced** in 2024 including **5 million tonnes automotive steel plates** from total capacity of **24 million tonnes annually** split equally between **12 million tonnes blast furnace** and **12 million tonnes electric arc furnace** capacity. The company announced a transformative **$5.8-7 billion investment** for a new **2.7 million tonnes per year** integrated steel mill in Louisiana with EAF-based production and direct reduced iron technology, targeting **2029 commercial production** with **1,300+ jobs** to supply Hyundai Motor and Kia's Alabama and Georgia plants while bypassing punitive U.S. tariffs. However, domestic challenges forced a **six-month overhaul** of the Incheon plant and **closure of Pohang Plant 2** in November 2024 due to Chinese low-priced steel competition.

South Korea exported approximately **25-30 million tonnes estimated annually** with steel exports valued at **$25.73 billion** in 2023 against imports of **$16.5 billion**, transforming from historical net importer to strong net exporter. Major destinations include the **United States at 2.809 million tonnes** (up 7% in 2024), China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and over 70 countries total, with competitive advantages in high-tech automotive steel, shipbuilding steel, and specialized products commanding premium pricing despite lower volumes than Chinese competitors. The United States imposed **25% tariffs** on steel imports, later increased to **50%** in June 2025, creating significant headwinds though the **Philippines-South Korea FTA** provides preferential access to growing ASEAN markets.

South Korean producers lead global technological capabilities through smart factory initiatives integrating AI and IoT for operational efficiency, with POSCO employing **FINEX low-carbon steelmaking technology** while Hyundai Steel develops proprietary **HyREX hydrogen-enriched DRI** without unloading and transport requirements. Both companies committed to ambitious **2030 targets of 50% carbon reduction** versus 2018 baselines through hydrogen injection in blast furnaces and carbon capture, advancing to **2040 further reductions** via DRI technology before **full H2-DRI-EAF transition** to achieve **net-zero by 2050**. POSCO leads **grain-oriented electrical steel** production with **1.16 million tonnes per year capacity** as global technology leader while both companies invest heavily in advanced high-strength steels for automotive applications and specialized marine grades for shipbuilding.

## Southeast Asia capacity explosion risks severe regional overcapacity

ASEAN-6 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) possess **78.1 million tonnes crude steel capacity** as of 2022 but operated at just **64.6% utilization**, producing **50.5 million tonnes** against demand of **75.1 million tonnes**. This stark imbalance masks a looming crisis as **Chinese investment drives explosive capacity expansion** toward a projected **184.5 million tonnes by 2029-2030**—representing **2.3x current capacity**—while demand growth remains modest at **5-6% annually** toward **80 million tonnes by 2025**. The capacity tsunami includes **Malaysia's 30 million tonnes of additions** (21 million tonnes confirmed for 2024), **Indonesia's 17+ million tonnes planned**, and **Vietnam's 20 million tonnes** scheduled for 2023-2026, predominantly financed by Chinese companies including WenAn Steel, Alliance Steel, Oriental Shield, and Eastern Steel.

Vietnam emerges as clear regional leader with **22 million tonnes crude steel production** in 2024 (up 7%), **30 million tonnes finished steel**, and ranking among the **top 30 global producers**. Hoa Phat Group dominates as **Southeast Asia's largest producer** with current capacity approaching **10 million tonnes** crude steel, expanding to **15 million tonnes by late 2025** upon completion of the **Dung Quat 2 complex** (VND 85 trillion/$3.34 billion investment adding **5.6 million tonnes hot-rolled coil capacity**), targeting **22 million tonnes long-term**. First-half 2025 production reached **5.1 million tonnes** (up 17% year-over-year) with August 2025 achieving **31,800 tonnes daily** (up 34% year-over-year), demonstrating aggressive ramp-up supported by government infrastructure mega-projects and urbanization targeting **45% by 2025** and **50% by 2030**.

Indonesia produced **17 million tonnes** in 2024 (up 0.9%) from **21 million tonnes national capacity**, ranking **14th globally** and targeting **27 million tonnes by 2029**. State-owned Krakatau Steel operates **5.9 million tonnes capacity** (over 50% of national total) with a joint venture alongside POSCO (Krakatau Posco - **3 million tonnes per year**), while announcing a **4 million tonne long steel plant** with China Baowu Group (investment $1.2 billion). The country plans **Sh220 billion** ($1.6 billion) investment in integrated iron and steel plants for the new capital Nusantara requiring **500,000-700,000 tonnes steel** as part of total $32.4 billion construction cost. Multiple Chinese investments total **17+ million tonnes planned capacity**, though domestic consumption of **12.7 million tonnes** in 2022 against production of only **6.8 million tonnes** required **~50% imports**, projected to reach **22 million tonnes by 2025** and **125 million tonnes by 2050**.

Thailand operates **~10 million tonnes annual capacity** primarily via electric arc furnaces but faces severe competitive pressures with **capacity utilization collapsing to 29.3%** in first-half 2024—the **lowest in seven years**—as **60-69% of consumption relies on imports** amid cheap Chinese steel influx. Nippon Steel acquired **49.99% of GSteel** and **40.45% of GJSteel** for **$419 million**, joining Tata Steel Thailand as major producers, though **71 factories closed in 2025** due to competition. Malaysia possesses **16.1 million tonnes capacity** but produced only **8.8 million tonnes** in 2024 for **39.1% utilization**, ranking **21st globally** (up from 39th in 2017) with Lion Group and Malaysia Steel Works combining for **~50% market share**. The government imposed a **two-year moratorium in August 2023** on expansion and diversification to address severe overcapacity, developing a **Green Transition Roadmap** focused on decarbonization. Taiwan's China Steel Corporation operates **15.86 million tonnes per annum capacity** producing **~12.65 million tonnes** in 2024, ranking **34th globally** as the island's dominant integrated steelmaker with **over 50% domestic market share** and **~30% exports** primarily to China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.

## Europe confronts existential crisis amid energy costs and import surge

European Union crude steel production reached **129.5 million tonnes** in 2024, representing a **2.6% increase** from 2023's 126.3 million tonnes but still dramatically below the **160 million tonnes** produced in 2017, reflecting a **near one-third reduction** since the financial crisis. Capacity utilization remained at unsustainable **60-65%** throughout 2024 as the industry confronts what leaders describe as a **"perfect storm"** of challenges: global overcapacity, unfair trade, energy costs **2-3x higher than U.S. levels**, weak demand, and decarbonization pressures requiring unprecedented capital while business cases remain negative. The crisis manifests in **8-9+ million tonnes idle capacity**, **11,000 job cuts** at ThyssenKrupp alone, and warnings from industry associations that **"all European steel plants are at risk"** without immediate policy intervention.

ArcelorMittal dominates as Europe's largest producer with **57.9 million tonnes global production** in 2024 and **$62.4 billion revenue**, operating **five blast furnaces in France**, **three in Germany**, plus facilities in Spain, Belgium, and Poland. The company shocked the industry in late 2024 by **postponing all European DRI-EAF decarbonization investments indefinitely** despite billions in approved subsidies, citing green hydrogen "evolving very slowly" with costs at **€6-7/kg versus €2/kg needed** for competitiveness, CBAM weaknesses, insufficient trade protection from Chinese imports, and limited customer willingness to pay green steel premiums. ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe announced **11,000 job reductions by 2030** (40% of steel workforce comprising 5,000 direct cuts plus 6,000 transfers), suspended **Blast Furnace 9 in Duisburg**, and placed hydrogen DRI plans under review despite **€2 billion committed state support** (€500 million already paid).

Import competition reached crisis levels with the European Union's import share hitting **27-28% of the market** in 2024-2025—historically high compared to typical 20-25%—as Chinese exports of **110.72 million tonnes** in 2024 (up 22.7%) flooded global markets at prices **10-20% below European producers**. European hot-rolled coil prices fell **12% year-over-year** through November 2024 due to import pressure, with Southeast Asian suppliers offering deeply discounted Indonesian material at **€480/tonne CIF** in September 2025. The European Commission proposed a **new steel safeguard measure** by third-quarter 2025 to replace expiring quotas, featuring a **47% reduction in duty-free volumes** to **18.3 million tonnes annually** with tariff rates **doubled from 25% to 50%** for over-quota imports, alongside **29 anti-dumping investigations** launched in 2024 covering Egypt, India, Japan, and Vietnam.

Energy costs represent the fundamental competitive disadvantage, with EU electricity averaging **€0.16/kWh** in 2024 compared to **€0.07/kWh in the United States** (2-3x cheaper) and roughly **50% lower in China**, while natural gas prices run **nearly 5x U.S. levels**. Energy represented **17% of steel production costs** pre-crisis but spiked to **80%** at the 2022 peak, remaining **2-3x historical levels** through 2024-2025 despite declining from extremes. Germany suffers particularly with the **highest grid fees in Europe**, contributing to the **lowest profitability** among major producers. The German government committed **€6.5 billion for 2026** to subsidize transmission tariffs providing **50% cost reduction**, though industry criticizes one-year support as insufficient without long-term structural reform. Hydrogen costs of **€6-7/kg** versus the **€2/kg** required make green steel economically unviable without sustained policy support.

Major green steel projects face uncertain futures despite unprecedented public support totaling **€15.1 billion in grants** plus **€700 million in EIB concessional loans** for three projects, with **90% targeting the DRI-EAF route**. **H2 Green Steel** (now Stegra) in Boden, Sweden represents the **most advanced large-scale project** with construction underway and first equipment installed, targeting **2.5 million tonnes initially** expanding to **5 million tonnes by 2030** using green hydrogen via electrolysis plus DRI plus EAF for **95% CO₂ reduction** versus traditional routes. Total funding of **€6.5 billion** is secured (€1.8+ billion equity, €3.5+ billion debt) with **1.5+ million tonnes pre-sold** to BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, IKEA, Scania, ZF Group, and Porsche. **HYBRIT** in Sweden achieved commercial success with demonstration phase operational since 2020 in Luleå, receiving **€143 million from the EU Innovation Fund** for a **1.3 million tonnes per year** demonstration plant producing fossil-free steel delivered to Volvo in 2021.

The **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism** entered its transitional period October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025 requiring **reporting only without financial obligations**, shifting to the **definitive period January 1, 2026** mandating purchase and surrender of CBAM certificates. Recent amendments adopted October 8, 2025 introduced a **50-tonne exemption threshold** covering **99% of emissions** while exempting **~182,000 importers** (mostly SMEs), reduced quarterly minimum certificate purchases from **80% to 50%** of embedded emissions, and allow importers to claim reductions for carbon prices paid in origin countries. However, industry criticizes **"significant weaknesses"** enabling circumvention through resource shuffling (exporting clean steel to EU while shipping dirty steel elsewhere), with the Commission planning reforms by end-2025 to close loopholes. CBAM aligns with the **EU ETS free allowance phase-out** from 2026-2034 but fails to address carbon leakage for EU exports to third countries, creating a fundamental asymmetry.

Plant closures and restructuring accelerated throughout 2024-2025 beyond ThyssenKrupp's dramatic retrenchment. **Tata Steel shut down both Port Talbot blast furnaces** in July and September 2024, ending **over 100 years of primary steelmaking** in the UK with **2,800 job cuts**, transitioning to EAF by 2027, while pursuing potential sale of Netherlands operations to SSAB. **Liberty Steel** (GFG Alliance) faces the most extensive crisis with **prolonged downtime** at Czech Republic's Ostrava (bankruptcy process, sale attempted), Belgium's Dudelange (government considering buyout), Romania's Galati (**9+ months idle**, liquidity crisis, two-month restructuring deadline), and Hungary's Dunaújváros (bankruptcy risk, deteriorating government relations), collectively accounting for significant portions of the **8-9 million tonnes idle in Eastern Europe**. **Salzgitter postponed its Salcos green steel project** for three years in 2025 despite over **€1 billion approved EU funding**, while ArcelorMittal experienced major disruptions including a **major fire at Fos-sur-Mer damaging BF2** and the steelmaking shop (two-month shutdown), plus closures at Reims and Denain facilities in France (136 jobs).

The European Union launched the comprehensive **Steel and Metals Action Plan** on March 19, 2025 with six pillars: decarbonization support and lead markets for low-carbon products, affordable energy, trade protection, CBAM reform and carbon leakage prevention, circular economy and scrap availability, and skills and social dimensions. Financial commitments include **€15.1 billion in decarbonization grants** (€500 million added in past six months) concentrated heavily in Germany at **€7 billion** (46% of total, disproportionate to 35% of BOF output), Netherlands at **€3 billion expected**, France at **€850 million+**, Spain at **€460 million**, and Belgium at **€280 million**. The **€1 billion pilot auction** for industrial decarbonization launches in 2025 open to all energy-intensive sectors, funded by EU ETS revenues. However, only **8 of 23 approved projects have broken ground** due to unfavorable business cases from low steel prices, high energy costs, and weak green steel demand, prompting industry warnings that funding availability means little without addressing fundamental economics.

## Africa shows growth potential amid infrastructure needs and Chinese investment

African steel production reached approximately **22-24 million tonnes annually** in 2024 with monthly output of **1.8-2.0 million tonnes** according to World Steel Association reporting, growing at **1.1% year-over-year** in 2024 with modest month-to-month variations ranging from **-3.5% to +8.2%** depending on seasonal and economic factors. The continent's steel market totaled approximately **39.5 million tonnes** in 2024, projected to grow at **3.1-3.4% CAGR** to reach **51-53 million tonnes by 2034** driven by infrastructure development, urbanization, construction booms, renewable energy installations, and manufacturing sector expansion across multiple regions.

South Africa's ArcelorMittal South Africa dominates sub-Saharan production as the **largest steel producer** with installed capacity of **5-7.8 million tonnes per annum**, though operating far below potential with **2.8 million tonnes liquid steel** produced in 2023 (14% increase from 2022) and anticipated **2.3% lower output** in 2024. The company shut down its **long steel business** at Newcastle and Vereeniging operations in January 2025, reporting **R5.1 billion headline loss** for fiscal 2024 including **R1.1 billion operating loss** in the longs segment, as international steel prices collapsed to **unsustainably low levels around $500/tonne** for Chinese hot-rolled coil and rebar in fourth-quarter 2024. Energy costs reached **R3.2 billion** spent on Eskom electricity in 2024 (up 14% from 2023) with tariffs increasing **835% over the past decade**, while poor Transnet Freight Rail performance resulted in lost production and sales amid market decline seeing apparent steel consumption down **20% over seven years** to approximately **4 million tonnes**.

African iron ore resources provide enormous long-term advantages, headlined by Guinea's **Simandou project**—the **world's largest untapped high-grade iron ore deposit**—with **110-kilometer range** containing billions of tonnes. Blocks 3 & 4 under Simfer consortium (Rio Tinto plus CIOH comprising Chinalco 75%, Baowu 20%, CRCC 2.5%, CHEC 2.5%) target **60 million tonnes per annum by 2028** with **$6.2 billion Rio Tinto investment** in a **~$25 billion total project** scheduled to begin production October 2025. Blocks 1 & 2 under Winning Consortium Simandou (Winning International Group 50%, Weiqiao Aluminium 50%) also target **60 million tonnes per annum** for **combined 120 million tonnes total**—the **highest-capacity heavy-haul railway in Africa** at **536km dual track** plus port at Matakong, accounting for an anticipated **5% of total global seaborne iron ore supply**. South Africa's **Sishen Mine** (Anglo American, Northern Cape) produces **26 million tonnes per annum** (2023) from one of the world's largest open-pit mines (~14km long) with life until 2039, while **Khumani Mine** and **Beeshoek Mine** (African Rainbow Minerals) produce **2.98 million tonnes per annum** at Beeshoek with life until 2035.

Nigeria's steel sector remains trapped in decades of dysfunction despite enormous potential, with the **Ajaokuta Steel Company** still non-operational after **45+ years** (construction began 1979) despite **designed 5 million tonnes liquid steel capacity annually** and **95-98% completion**, sitting on **24,000 hectares** in Kogi State with light mills operational only since 2018 for small-scale fabrication and iron rod production. Fundamental challenges include inadequate iron ore quality (45% purity versus 67% required), costly beneficiation plant needed at Itakpe, outdated blast furnace technology, poor iron-coal quality (non-coking), persistent mismanagement and policy failures, plus rail connectivity issues. Revival attempts continue with **January 2024 discussions** with Chinese Luan Steel Holding Group, **N4.45 billion allocated** in 2024 budget seeking **N35 billion from investors**, and a **September 2024 MoU** with original Russian builders (TPE), alongside a **N30-35 billion light steel mill** planned to produce **50,000 metric tonnes iron rods**, though actual national production remains approximately **2.2 million tonnes annually** against **10 million tonnes installed capacity** severely underutilized while spending approximately **$3.3 billion annually** on steel imports.

Kenya's steel sector shows promise with annual demand of **480,000-600,000 tonnes**, positioning as the **largest manufacturer of exported steel products** within COMESA and EAC regions to destinations including Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of Congo. **Devki Steel Mills** operates as **East Africa's largest steel manufacturer** with headquarters in Ruiru plus operations in Mombasa and Athi River, producing billets, wire rods, reinforcement bars, and structural steel while expanding to **100,000 tonnes annually** when fully automated and planning a **$175 million plant in Kitui** for iron ore mining and processing.

## Americas markets fragment under protectionism and consolidation pressures

United States steel production reached **88 million net tons** in 2024 (down 2% from 89.7 million in 2023), rebounding to **77.2 million net tons** year-to-date through November 8, 2025 (up 3.1% versus same period 2024) with **capacity utilization improving to 77% average** in 2025 from 75.5% in 2024. The industry underwent dramatic structural changes as **Nippon Steel completed its $14.9 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel** on June 18, 2025 after President Trump reversed President Biden's January 3, 2025 national security block, imposing strict conditions including a **"golden share"** granting the U.S. government veto power over moving headquarters from Pittsburgh, plant closures, job reductions, capital investment changes, and material trade decisions, alongside requirements for a **majority U.S. citizen board**, **American CEO**, and **$11-14 billion new investments** over 14 months with no layoffs or closings from the transaction.

Electric arc furnace technology dominates with **over 70% of U.S. production** (growing), adding **16.1 million short tons per year** of new EAF capacity during fourth-quarter 2023 through 2025, while blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace routes declined below **30% and falling** as scrap availability, lower emissions, and efficiency advantages drive the technology transition. **Nucor Corporation** leads as the largest U.S. steelmaker with **100% EAF-based production** using scrap, pricing hot-rolled coil base at **$860/short ton** in February 2025 later adjusted to **$930/st**, operating mini-mills and macro EAF facilities nationwide with strength in both long products and flat-rolled steel. **Cleveland-Cliffs** emerged as the **largest flat-rolled producer** operating integrated blast furnace facilities with aggressive pricing at **$975/ton** in May 2025 and **$900/ton** in April 2025, acquiring Canadian producer **Stelco for $2.5 billion** in November 2024 to create a potential **top-10 global producer**, though subsequently idling its Dearborn, Michigan plant in March 2025 due to tariff impacts on the automotive sector.

Section 232 steel tariffs reshaped trade flows after President Trump restored **25% tariffs on March 12, 2025**, eliminating all country exemptions, then increased rates to **50% on June 4, 2025** on steel and aluminum from nearly all trading partners except the UK (maintained at 25% with potential tariff-rate quota by July 9, 2025). The administration expanded coverage on **August 18, 2025** to include **407+ derivative product codes**, applying to steel/aluminum content while non-steel/aluminum content faces reciprocal tariffs, with previously granted exclusions remaining valid until expiration though **no new product exclusions accepted** after February 10, 2025. Steel products subject to Section 232 gain exemption from IEEPA reciprocal tariffs, creating a complex dual tariff regime designed to achieve **80%+ domestic capacity utilization** while strengthening pricing power. Import penetration declined to **22% market share** in 2024 from higher levels, with **January-July 2025 steel imports falling by value** versus 2024 as protective measures took effect.

Canada produced **12.80 million metric tons** in 2024 with forecasts of **2.6% CAGR growth to 16.55 million tonnes by 2034**, contributing **$4.5+ billion to GDP** and employing **~23,600 workers** across major producers. **Algoma Steel** in Sault Ste. Marie undergoes major transformation converting from blast furnace to electric arc furnace, expanding capacity from **2.8 million tonnes annually to 3.7 million tonnes** with first EAF achieving initial steel production in July 2025 targeting **70% emissions reduction** by completion, supported by **$500 million in federal/provincial tariff-relief loans** though reconsidering U.S. market presence due to **50% tariffs**. Cleveland-Cliffs' **acquisition of Stelco for $2.5 billion** in November 2024 consolidated Canada's second-largest producer (approximately **2 million tonnes annually** from Hamilton, Ontario) still operating blast furnace technology without announced decarbonization strategy, while **ArcelorMittal Dofasco** as Canada's largest producer delayed its **$1.8 billion green steel project** announced in 2022, remaining in engineering phase through 2025.

Canada exported **6.56 million short tons to the U.S.** in 2024 (largest supplier) including **3.95 million st flat-rolled** (equivalent to **330,000 st monthly** matching major mill output), though the **June 2025 imposition of 50% tariffs** dramatically altered trade patterns with Canadian producers **scaling back U.S. presence**, Stelco tons being kept in Canada per Cleveland-Cliffs, and Algoma reconsidering market participation despite prior U.S.-focused strategies. Canada imposed **25% retaliatory tariffs** on **C$15.6 billion of U.S. steel and aluminum** as of September 2025 while the USMCA trade framework remains technically in force though tariffs override previous preferential arrangements, fundamentally reshaping continental steel trade.

Mexico produced approximately **16.2 million metric tons** crude steel in 2023 with estimates ranging to **13.7-19 million tonnes** in 2024 (sources vary; 19.6 million tonnes cited for 2022), ranking as the **second-largest Latin American producer** and **15th globally** with steel market projected to reach **28 million tonnes capacity** after current expansions complete. **Ternium SA** dominates with **82-84% of the Mexican hot-rolled market**, operating the major Pesquería Industrial Center in Nuevo León where Phase 3 expansion completes in 2025-2026 adding a **new EAF of 2.6 million mt/yr capacity**, **DRI plant of 2.1 million mt/yr**, **cold rolling mill of 1.6 million mt/yr** expected 2025/2026, and **galvanizing line of 600,000 mt/yr** by end-2025, representing **$2.2-2.6 billion total Phase 3 investment** that follows earlier phases establishing **4.4 million stpy hot strip mill** with **$1.1 billion** investment during 2010-2021. Ternium produced approximately **18.1 million tonnes** in 2024 (18% year-over-year growth) positioning as primary nearshoring beneficiary under President Sheinbaum's policies.

**Altos Hornos de México** (AHMSA), historically the largest integrated producer with **5.5 million tonnes per year capacity**, entered **severe financial distress** halting production multiple times during 2024-2025 as the government attempts to find a buyer (potential acquirers: Ternium or ArcelorMittal) to save **17,000 jobs** (direct and indirect) in the Monclova, Coahuila region. **DeAcero** completes a **new $1.3 billion mill** in Coahuila in February 2026 adding **1.2 million tonnes capacity** to its current **1.5 million tonnes** using EAF technology with renewable energy focus, while **ArcelorMittal Las Truchas** operates a **hot strip mill at 2.75 million stpy** started in 2021 at Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. Nearshoring opportunities surged with **2,000+ Chinese companies relocated to Mexico** in 2024 driving government focus on semiconductors, electronics, medical devices, EVs, and agroindustry supported by infrastructure including the **Interoceanic Corridor railway** in southern Mexico, though **Section 232 tariffs of 50%** on steel exports to the United States plus import competition from China led to government **import registration requirements in May 2025** and Ternium's **dumping complaint against Chinese/Vietnamese hot-rolled steel** in March 2025.

Brazil produced **33.8 million metric tons** in 2024 (up from 31.8 million in 2023) from **44 million tonnes capacity across 21 steel plants**, maintaining position as **Latin America's largest producer** and **ninth globally**, dominated by three major producers struggling with Chinese import surge. **Gerdau SA** ranks as the **12th-largest producer globally** and Brazil's leading long steel manufacturer primarily using **EAF-based technology** (73% scrap utilization) with exceptionally low emissions of **0.93 tons CO₂ per ton steel** due to EAF plus biochar, adding a **new HRC line at Ouro Branco** in March 2025 for **230,000 tonnes per year additional capacity** totaling **1 million tonnes HRC annually** with **$260 million investment**, though the CEO warned new capacity could sit idle due to Chinese imports as stock fell **4.58%** in 2024. **Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional** (CSN) operates Brazil's second-largest and **largest complete steel production system** at Volta Redonda (Rio de Janeiro state)—**Latin America's largest steel base**—with stock dropping **40.76%** in 2024 though fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations despite high debt creating cash burn, targeting **-10% emissions by 2030** and **-20% by 2035** versus 2018 baseline.

**Usiminas** as the third major flat-rolled producer operates primarily from Ipatinga, Minas Gerais (accounting for 70% of emissions) with **79,000 tpy seamed tubes** at Porto Alegre unit, investing **$538 million in blast furnace modernization** in 2024 while **idling furnace #1 in December 2024** and considering **idling furnace #2** if import pressure continues, with stock falling **50.09%** in 2024 (prices, imports, currency devaluation) though second-quarter 2025 showed turnaround with **24% net debt reduction**, targeting **-15% emissions by 2030** versus 2019. Brazil confronted an import crisis as **2024 steel imports surged 24% to record 6.23 million tonnes** with **92% from China** representing **25% of domestic demand** and particularly damaging in hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and semi-finished products, causing domestic prices to command only **5-10% premiums versus imports** (historically 30-40%), prompting industry to request **25% import duty** in April 2024 awaiting government decision. The government responded in July 2025 by **extending steel import quota system for 12 months**, expanding from **19 to 23 restricted product types** with **within-quota tariffs of 9-16%** and **above-quota tariffs of 25%**, plus **anti-dumping measures on 26 steel products from 13 countries** including China, India, and Vietnam.

Argentina produced approximately **5 million metric tons annually** in 2024 with monthly production showing recovery after prolonged economic crisis, with July 2024 at **314,000 tonnes** (up 14.2% month-on-month) including **hot-rolled at 177,000 tonnes** (up 39%), **cold-rolled at 95,000 tonnes** (up 15.4%), and **long products at 117,000 tonnes** (up 9.4%), though still showing year-over-year declines throughout 2024. The government lifted the **ban on scrap metal exports** in January 2025 for both ferrous and non-ferrous materials as part of broader economic reforms expected to have recessionary effects in first-half 2024, while **Sidersa announced** a new green steel plant in San Nicolás, Buenos Aires in August 2025 focusing on steel bar and wire rod using sustainable technologies and import substitution strategy. Argentina's **$5.04 billion market** in 2024 projects **3.12% CAGR growth to $6.64 billion by 2033**, ranking as Latin America's **third-largest producer** at **8% of regional production** with consumption of **4.8 million tonnes** and increasing modernization including EAF adoption.

## Future scenarios depend on coordinated capacity discipline and policy support

The global steel industry faces divergent pathways through 2030 hinging on three critical variables: capacity discipline, technology deployment speed, and trade regime evolution. The **base case scenario** projects continued overcapacity pressures with utilization rates declining toward **70% by 2027** absent coordinated production cuts, as **165 million tonnes of planned additions** during 2025-2027 collide with modest **1.2-1.3% annual demand growth** in developed markets and China's **2-3% annual structural decline** offsetting India's **8-9% growth** and developing market expansion at **3.4-4.7% annually**. This trajectory sustains **EBITDA margins in the unsustainable 8-10% range**, preventing adequate cash generation for green transitions while triggering additional plant closures particularly in Europe where **60-65% utilization** persists and energy cost disadvantages of **2-3x versus U.S. levels** remain unaddressed.

The **accelerated green transition scenario** requires achieving **200 million tonnes low-emissions capacity by 2030** versus current projections of 100 million tonnes, necessitating green hydrogen costs declining from current **€6-7/kg to €2-3/kg** through massive electrolyzer deployment and renewable energy expansion, coupled with effective carbon pricing mechanisms via strengthened CBAM implementation providing **€50-100/tonne CO₂ price signals** versus current ~€25/tonne to justify **$200-500/tonne green steel premiums**. This pathway demands coordination of **$200+ billion cumulative investment** during 2025-2030 split between **private capital leveraging improved economics** and **sustained public support** maintaining Europe's **€15+ billion subsidy base**, U.S. Inflation Reduction Act incentives, and similar Asian programs while establishing robust **demand-side policies** including green public procurement mandates and automotive sector low-carbon steel requirements.

China's trajectory proves decisive for all scenarios given its **53% global production share** and **1.25-1.3 billion tonne capacity** against **892.87 million tonne domestic consumption**. Government capacity discipline through the **August 2024 suspension** preventing new blast furnaces plus enforcement of **53 million tonnes CO₂ reduction targets** during 2024-2025 could constrain exports from 2024's **record 110.72 million tonnes** toward **80-90 million tonnes sustainably**, alleviating global price pressure and enabling producer profitability recovery. However, persistent **provincial protectionism** blocking consolidation, continued **state subsidy rates 10x higher than OECD countries**, and political prioritization of employment over efficiency create downside risks of sustained **100+ million tonne annual exports** perpetuating the crisis. China's **10+ million tonnes hydrogen-based DRI capacity by 2030** plus **EAF share targets of 20%** by that date position it as potential green steel leader if execution follows ambition, with costs advantages from **projected $2.40/kg hydrogen** versus European **€6-7/kg** proving transformational.

Regional positioning strategies must adapt to trade fragmentation as the **post-2025 regime** features sustained high U.S. tariffs at **50%**, European safeguards with **doubled over-quota rates**, and proliferating bilateral protection measures replacing the prior rules-based system. Producers optimally positioned possess combinations of: **low-cost renewable energy access** (Middle East gas, Brazil/Canada hydro, U.S./China solar/wind), **proximity to growing end-markets** (India, ASEAN, Mexico nearshoring), **advanced technology capabilities** (Japan hydrogen, South Korea electrical steel, European specialty grades), and **scale advantages** in strategic products. India's **trajectory toward 300 million tonnes capacity by 2030-31** with **100 million tonnes additions** positions it as the **future second-largest producer** globally with potential export capacity of **30-40 million tonnes** by 2035 as domestic per capita consumption reaches only **160 kg** versus developed market **400-600 kg**, though import protection via **12% safeguard duties** and quota systems indicates continued vulnerability to Chinese competition.

The **technology transition timeline** spans three phases: near-term 2025-2030 dominated by **natural gas-based DRI as bridge technology** offering **15-25% emissions reduction** at manageable cost premiums, with **EAF share globally increasing from 28% to 35-40%** leveraging scrap availability and renewable electricity; medium-term 2030-2040 featuring **commercial-scale hydrogen-based DRI-EAF deployment** achieving **70-95% reduction** as hydrogen costs decline below **$3/kg** and renewable electricity reaches **$20-30/MWh**, with leaders like **H2 Green Steel**, **HYBRIT**, and Chinese facilities demonstrating viability and establishing **50-100 million tonnes cumulative capacity**; and long-term 2040-2050 requiring **fundamental transformation of 70%+ of primary capacity** to low-carbon routes with remaining blast furnaces operating only with **full CCUS** capturing **90%+ emissions**, collectively enabling industry net-zero by 2050 with interim milestones of **30% reduction by 2030** and **50-70% reduction by 2040** versus 2020 baselines.
