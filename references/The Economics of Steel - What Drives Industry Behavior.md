# The Economics of Steel: What Drives Industry Behavior

The global steel industry operates on razor-thin margins determined by the interplay of **three dominant forces**: production technology (EAF vs. blast furnace), capacity utilization rates, and Chinese overcapacity. For US producers, Section 232 tariffs at 50% create a protected market where domestic prices run **$500+ per ton above global levels**, enabling profitability that would be impossible in open competition. The strategic decisions we observe—Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for US Steel, Cleveland-Cliffs' consolidation spree, and the industry-wide pivot to EAF technology—all flow from these fundamental economics.

Understanding steel economics requires grasping one central reality: this is a commodity business where **cost position determines destiny**. The difference between a low-cost EAF producer like Nucor generating 18-19% ROIC and an integrated producer like US Steel earning just 3% ROIC comes down to technology choice, scale, and feedstock costs. With global overcapacity at 602 million metric tons in 2024—equivalent to **five times the EU's total annual production**—and projected to reach 721 million tons by 2027, survival depends on being positioned on the left side of the cost curve.

## Demand is dominated by construction and follows GDP with a multiplier

Steel demand concentrates in a handful of end markets that determine the industry's cyclical fate. Globally, **construction and infrastructure absorb 49-52% of steel consumption**, with the remaining demand split among machinery and equipment (16%), automotive (12-14%), metal products (11%), oil and gas (6%), and appliances (3%). In the US market specifically, construction's share reaches 42% when combined with infrastructure, while automotive represents 20-25% of flat-rolled steel consumption.

The steel-GDP relationship follows the classic intensity-of-use curve: developing economies show strong positive correlation as industrialization drives steel-intensive construction, while mature economies exhibit declining intensity as services grow. Steel consumption peaks at approximately **$13,000 GDP per capita** at around 500 kg per person annually. This explains the geographic demand shift underway: China, having passed peak intensity with real estate in structural decline, saw demand fall 3% in 2024 and will continue contracting 1-2% annually. Meanwhile, India—at just 93 kg per capita versus the global average of 219 kg—is growing 8-9% annually and will add 70 million tons of demand between 2020 and 2025.

The cyclicality is severe. Global steel experienced its longest downturn in 20 years from late 2021 through 2024, with three consecutive years of falling demand. The industry experienced a Steel Weighted Industrial Production index decline of 0.5% in 2025. Automotive represents a swing factor—as one analyst noted, "you don't tend to see sheet prices do well for long if auto isn't participating."

## EAF mini-mills hold structural cost and flexibility advantages over integrated producers

The economics of steelmaking split sharply between two production technologies with fundamentally different cost structures. Integrated blast furnace-BOF mills require capital intensity of approximately **$1,000 per ton of annual capacity**, versus just **$140-300 per ton for EAF mini-mills**—a 3-7x difference that shapes every investment decision in the industry.

Operating costs also favor EAFs: typical US production costs run $520-600 per ton for mini-mills versus $580-700 per ton for integrated mills. Raw materials dominate both cost structures but in different ways. Integrated mills spend 56-71% of costs on iron ore and coking coal purchased on multi-year contracts, while EAFs spend 61-77% on scrap purchased monthly on spot markets. Energy represents 7-15% for integrated mills versus 10-26% for EAFs, though EAFs consume **90% less total energy** per ton (2.3-6.1 GJ versus 23 GJ for blast furnaces).

The flexibility difference proves decisive during downturns. EAF mills can idle and restart at relatively low cost, achieving breakeven at **60-70% capacity utilization**, while integrated blast furnaces must run continuously and require 70-75% utilization to break even. A blast furnace shutdown costs $100+ million to restart. This explains why US capacity utilization of 77.5% in late 2025 translates to healthy margins for Nucor's EAF operations but pressure on Cleveland-Cliffs' integrated mills.

Regional cost variations are substantial. The gap between the lowest-cost producer (India at ~$450/ton for BF-BOF) and highest-cost (Germany at ~$850/ton) reached 46% by 2021. Within the US, plant-level cost differences of $110/ton exist between efficient and legacy facilities.

## Capacity utilization drives the margin cycle from loss to bonanza

Steel profitability hinges on capacity utilization with an amplification effect that creates dramatic cyclical swings. At 60% utilization, most integrated mills burn cash while EAFs operate marginally. At 70%, the industry approaches breakeven with low single-digit EBITDA margins. At **80% utilization, margins typically reach 8-12% EBITDA**—the level needed for healthy reinvestment. Above 90%, margins can surge to 15-25% as fixed costs spread across maximum output.

This utilization sensitivity explains the spectacular margin expansion during 2021-2022. US HRC prices rocketed from a COVID trough of **$499 per short ton in June 2020** to an all-time peak of **$1,945 in August 2021**—a nearly 4x increase in 14 months. Nucor achieved EBITDA margins of 28% and record earnings of $7.58 billion in 2022. Cleveland-Cliffs hit 24% EBITDA margins in 2021 with $3 billion net income.

The correction proved equally dramatic. Prices fell back to $600 per ton by November 2022 as demand softened, inventories destocked, and recession fears emerged. By 2023-2024, Nucor's margins normalized to 18-21% while Cleveland-Cliffs compressed to 9%—demonstrating the integrated model's greater vulnerability to cycle downturns.

Current US prices of $875-976 per ton remain elevated relative to history due to Section 232 tariffs. The 50% tariff (raised from 25% in June 2025) creates effective import parity around $750 per ton when adding freight to Asian steel, supporting a domestic premium of approximately **$225 per ton** even with full tariff burden.

## Chinese overcapacity is the defining feature of global steel economics

China's steel industry operates as a policy instrument rather than a market-driven sector, with consequences that reverberate globally. With capacity of 1.25-1.30 billion tons against domestic demand of approximately 1 billion tons, China holds **50+ million tons of structural surplus** that must find homes abroad. Chinese steelmakers exported a record 110.7-118 million tons in 2024, up 23% year-over-year, at prices 25% below the prior year.

The subsidy intensity is staggering. OECD research shows Chinese steel subsidy rates run **10 times higher than OECD countries** as a percentage of firm revenues. Over $50 billion in documented subsidies includes preferential loans ($17.3 billion), equity infusions and debt-to-equity swaps ($18.6 billion), land-use discounts ($5 billion), and government-mandated mergers ($1.2 billion). Eight of the ten largest Chinese steel groups are 100% government controlled.

These subsidies enable loss-making operation: only 1% of Chinese mills were profitable in mid-2024, with the aggregate industry losing 2.76 billion yuan ($387 million) in the first seven months. Yet production continues, with exports depressing global prices. Southeast Asia absorbed 27 million tons in 2023, while indirect effects—Chinese exports displacing Korean and Turkish steel that then redirects to Western markets—spread the impact globally.

The global response has been a proliferation of trade barriers: 62 countries have implemented 207 restrictions against Chinese steel, including anti-dumping duties reaching 200%+ on some products. Yet exports remain near record highs, with excess capacity projected to reach 721 million tons by 2027—**exceeding combined OECD production by 290 million tons**.

## Nucor's EAF model generates superior returns through productivity and flexibility

Among major US producers, Nucor demonstrates how cost leadership translates to value creation. The company generates **18-19% ROIC against a 13% WACC**, creating sustained economic profit. This compares to US Steel's 3% ROIC against a 10% WACC—a spread that destroys shareholder value.

Nucor's advantages are structural rather than cyclical. As a 100% EAF producer using 82% recycled scrap, the company avoids blast furnace capital intensity and operating inflexibility. Labor productivity runs at industry-leading levels: workers average 20-25 tons per hour versus the industry standard of 6-10 tons. Despite paying steelworkers $63,000-90,000 annually—among the highest in the industry—Nucor achieves the **lowest labor cost per ton** through performance-based incentives that align worker and shareholder interests.

The non-union workforce enables operational flexibility that unionized competitors cannot match. Nucor can idle and restart facilities rapidly, adjust production to market conditions, and avoid legacy pension and healthcare costs that burden integrated producers. US Steel carries an estimated **$30-40 per ton burden** from retiree healthcare obligations.

Cleveland-Cliffs pursues a different strategy: complete vertical integration from iron ore mines through finishing and stamping. This provides feedstock cost stability—the company targets a $50 per ton unit cost reduction in 2025 versus 2024—but ties capital in asset-heavy operations and creates higher fixed costs during downturns. The company's 90% BF-BOF production mix, inherited from the ArcelorMittal USA acquisition, leaves it more exposed to utilization-driven margin swings.

## Consolidation economics favor fewer, larger players with pricing discipline

The wave of steel industry M&A reflects rational economics rather than empire building. Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for US Steel—representing a 40% premium and roughly $1,000+ per ton of capacity—reflects strategic value beyond asset replacement cost. The deal provides access to the US market's tariff protection, automotive customer relationships, and electrical steel capabilities that would take a decade to build organically.

Cleveland-Cliffs' acquisition spree followed similar logic. The ArcelorMittal USA purchase for approximately $1.4 billion ($162 per ton of capacity) created the largest flat-rolled producer in North America with expected synergies of $150 million annually. Combined with the AK Steel acquisition ($120 million annual synergies), Cliffs achieved scale that enables automotive contract negotiations, capacity discipline, and supply chain optimization impossible for smaller players.

Steel company valuations reflect the cyclicality: forward EV/EBITDA multiples range from 6-10x for EAF producers (Nucor at 6.8-10.2x) to 4-13x for integrated producers depending on cycle position. Cleveland-Cliffs trades at just 0.6x book value versus a 5-year average of 0.8x, suggesting market skepticism about integrated mill economics.

The consolidation benefits extend beyond cost synergies to pricing power. With fewer producers competing for constrained demand, the industry can maintain discipline on capacity additions and avoid the price-destructive behavior that characterized earlier decades. Cleveland-Cliffs' ability to post HRC prices at $975 per ton versus Nucor's $875—a $100 premium reflecting automotive contract mix and product differentiation—demonstrates how market structure enables pricing power.

## The technology transition from blast furnace to EAF is accelerating

US Steel's Big River Steel strategy exemplifies the industry's technological pivot. The company acquired the remaining 50.1% stake in Big River for $774 million in 2021, following a $700 million initial investment for 49.9%, building a 3.3 million ton EAF complex that now anchors the company's future. Capital costs ran approximately **$813 per ton for greenfield construction**, declining to $424 per ton for expansion phases—still below integrated mill costs but above typical EAF brownfield economics.

The economics favor conversion when electricity costs remain below $0.05-0.06 per kWh and scrap supply is abundant. The US satisfies both conditions: EAF already represents 71% of domestic production, and scrap availability benefits from the country's historical manufacturing base. Big River Steel achieved productivity of approximately 5,000 tons per employee annually—world-class efficiency that legacy integrated mills cannot match.

ArcelorMittal's European decarbonization struggles illustrate the constraints. The company cancelled €1.3 billion in planned DRI-EAF investments in Germany due to high electricity prices, weak demand, and policy uncertainty. Meanwhile, Spanish projects proceed with more favorable economics. This geographic divergence—US and Spain advancing while Germany retreats—reflects how energy costs drive technology choices.

Cleveland-Cliffs' decision to maintain blast furnace operations despite higher carbon intensity reflects automotive quality requirements (virgin iron produces higher-purity steel) and the sunk cost of its Toledo HBI facility. The company targets hydrogen readiness, able to replace 30% of natural gas without modifications and 70% with investment, positioning for eventual transition without abandoning current assets.

## Decarbonization requires massive investment with uncertain returns

The steel industry faces a $300 billion global decarbonization investment requirement—approximately $10 billion annually through 2050—on top of business-as-usual capital spending. Hydrogen-based DRI-EAF routes require levelized hydrogen costs of **$1.4-1.7 per kg to achieve cost parity** with conventional blast furnaces, versus current costs of $4.5-6.5 per kg. At current hydrogen prices, the green premium reaches $225-325 per ton.

SSAB's HYBRIT project represents the leading edge: a €4.5 billion investment in Luleå, Sweden for 2.5 million tonnes of fossil-free capacity by 2028-2029. The project targets emissions below 0.05 kg CO2 per kg steel versus approximately 2.3 tonnes CO2 per tonne for conventional BF-BOF. Customers including Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and Scania have contracted for premium-priced green steel.

The green premium market remains nascent and geographically segmented. European buyers pay €50-140 per tonne above conventional steel, while Asian markets see 20-40% premiums. The US has no significant green premium—EAF already produces steel at below 0.8 tonnes CO2 per tonne, undermining the differentiation value. This positions US producers advantageously: already low-carbon without requiring massive investment.

ArcelorMittal allocates just $0.3-0.4 billion of its $4.5-5.0 billion annual capex budget to decarbonization, reflecting cautious economics. Projects must demonstrate returns exceeding cost of capital (8-13% for steel companies) while also meeting CO2 reduction targets. The tension between financial returns and environmental investment explains the industry's measured pace—and why European producers delay projects while US competitors advance EAF expansion.

## The near-term outlook shows modest growth constrained by overcapacity

The 2026-2028 period presents a mixed outlook: modest demand growth of 1-2% annually globally, with US outperformance at 1.5-2% supported by infrastructure spending. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act represents a generational tailwind, with bridge projects receiving $40 billion in allocations and peak spending expected in 2026-2027. Data center construction—driven by Amazon's $15 billion New Carlisle facility and similar hyperscaler investments—adds structural steel demand.

However, supply additions will pressure margins. North American capacity is expanding by 25+ million short tons with over $15 billion in announced investments, including US Steel's Big River 2, Nucor's West Virginia mill, and Hyundai Steel's $5.8 billion Louisiana facility. Global excess capacity reaching 721 million tons by 2027 maintains structural pressure on utilization rates, projected to hover around 70-75%—below the 80% threshold for healthy margins.

US HRC prices are expected to range **$800-900 per short ton** through 2028, with volatility around trade policy developments. The price cycle peak has been pushed to 2029 or later given unprecedented overcapacity expansion. China's demand trajectory represents the single most important uncertainty: a hard landing with 5% demand decline could trigger an export surge to 120+ million tons, collapsing global prices, while successful stimulus could stabilize the market.

For US producers, the calculus favors continued EAF investment, automotive and specialty steel focus, and opportunistic consolidation. Nucor's consensus earnings growth of 31% in 2026 reflects expected margin recovery from the 2025 trough. Cleveland-Cliffs targets $500 million annual EBITDA improvement from exiting loss-making slab supply contracts. The industry's survivors will be those positioned on the cost curve's left side when the next downturn arrives.

## Conclusion: Technology and trade policy determine winners

Steel economics ultimately reduce to a cost competition where technology choice, capacity utilization, and trade protection determine profitability. EAF producers hold structural advantages—lower capital intensity, operating flexibility, and superior returns—that explain the industry's technology transition. Chinese overcapacity and subsidization distort global markets, making trade barriers essential for non-Chinese producer survival.

The strategic decisions observed—Nippon's US Steel bid, Cleveland-Cliffs' consolidation, and the universal pivot toward EAF—reflect rational responses to these economics. With 721 million tons of excess capacity projected by 2027 and decarbonization requiring $300 billion in investment, the industry faces a decade of margin pressure interrupted by cyclical spikes. Winners will combine cost leadership, product differentiation toward automotive and electrical steels, and geographic positioning in protected markets with infrastructure demand. The era of steel as a commodity undifferentiated by producer is ending; the era of technology-driven competitive advantage is beginning.
