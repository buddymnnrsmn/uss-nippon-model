PRELIMINARY PROXY STATEMENT — SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED JANUARY 24, 2024
United States Steel Corporation
600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219-2800 (412) 433-1121
[	], 2024
Dear Fellow USS Stockholders:
Following a robust and comprehensive review of strategic alternatives, on December 18, 2023, United States Steel Corporation (which we refer to as “USS,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “Merger Agreement”) with Nippon Steel North America, Inc., a New York corporation (which we refer to as “Parent”), 2023 Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (which we refer to as “Merger Sub”), and, solely as provided in Section 9.13 therein, Nippon Steel Corporation, a Japanese corporation (which we refer to as “Guarantor” or “NSC”).
The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (which we refer to as the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and (ii) at the effective time of the Merger (which we refer to as the “Effective Time”), each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, par value $ 1.00 per share (which we refer to as “USS common stock”) (excluding (a) shares of USS common stock owned by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as treasury stock or otherwise, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shares of USS common stock held by any Company Employee Plan (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or trust related thereto (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of USS common stock reserved for issuance under any of the Company Equity Plans (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) shares of USS common stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares described in the foregoing clause (a)) and that are held by holders who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and are entitled to demand and properly demand, exercise and perfect appraisal of such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $55.00 per share in cash, without interest (which we refer to as the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any required tax withholding.
We will hold a special meeting of our stockholders (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting”) in connection with the proposed Merger on [	],
2024, at [	] Eastern Time, via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/[ ] (which we
refer to as the “Special Meeting website”), where you will be able to attend the Special Meeting, vote, and submit your questions. Please note you will not be able to attend the Special Meeting physically in person. For purposes of attendance at the Special Meeting, all references in the enclosed proxy statement to “present” shall mean virtually present at the Special Meeting and all references in the enclosed proxy statement to “attend” shall mean virtually attend the Special Meeting.
The Board of Directors of the Company (which we refer to as the “Board of Directors”), after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, has unanimously (i) determined that it is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (ii) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt the

Merger Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting.
At the Special Meeting, USS stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on (1) the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Merger Agreement Proposal”), (2) the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to USS’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Compensation Proposal”) and (3) any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (which we refer to as the “Adjournment Proposal”). The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Merger. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement.
The proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. You should carefully read and consider the entire enclosed proxy statement and its annexes, including the Merger Agreement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you.
Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of USS common stock that you own. Because stockholders cannot take any action at the Special Meeting unless one-third of the shares of USS common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat is represented, it is important that you attend the Special Meeting or are represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. The Merger cannot be completed unless the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock entitled to vote thereon. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting, please complete, date, sign and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying postage-prepaid reply envelope, or submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting — Voting at the Special Meeting”). If your shares of USS common stock are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee, your bank, broker or other nominee will be unable to vote your shares of USS common stock without instructions from you. You should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares of USS common stock in accordance with the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If your shares of USS common stock are held in your name and you fail to return your proxy card, submit your proxy by telephone or via the Internet or vote virtually at the Special Meeting, or if your shares of USS common stock are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee and you fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares of USS common stock, then this will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.
If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares of USS common stock, please contact USS’s proxy solicitor in connection with the Special Meeting:

The Merger (see page 91)
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (which we refer to as the “DGCL”), Merger Sub will merge with and into USS (which we refer to as the “Merger”), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and USS will continue its corporate existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation in the Merger (which we refer to as the “Surviving Corporation”).

If the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a stockholder of USS (except that stockholders who properly and validly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined under an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights”). The Merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger with respect to the Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later date or time as may be agreed by USS and Parent and specified in the certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL (which we refer to as the “Effective Time”).
Merger Consideration (see page 92)
USS Common Stock
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of USS, Parent, Merger Sub, or the holders of any securities of USS or Merger Sub, each share of USS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (a) each share that is owned by USS as treasury stock or otherwise, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shares of USS common stock held by any Company Employee Plan or trust related thereto (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under any of the Company Equity Plans) or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and (b) shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares described in the foregoing clause (a)) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of such Shares, as applicable, pursuant to, and who have properly exercised and perfected their demands for appraisal rights under and comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to collectively, as the “Excluded Shares”)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $55.00 in cash (which we refer to as the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any required tax withholding.

On the Closing Date, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with a designated paying agent a cash amount that is sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all shares of USS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of USS common stock that you own (other than any Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to any required tax withholding), but you will no longer have any rights as a USS stockholder (except that USS stockholders who properly and validly exercise, perfect and do not withdraw their appraisal rights will not be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and instead will have a right to receive payment of the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding, as contemplated by the DGCL). For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights.”
Treatment of USS Equity Awards
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each award of restricted stock units representing the right to be issued shares of USS common stock or cash valued by reference to the value of shares of USS common stock that is subject to time-based vesting restrictions (we refer to each such award as a “Company RSU Award”) (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company RSU Award (or portion thereof).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each award of restricted stock units representing the right to be issued shares of USS common stock or cash valued by reference to the value of shares of USS common stock that is subject to performance-based vesting restrictions (we refer to each such award as a “Company PSU Award”) (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company PSU Award (or portion thereof). The total number of shares of USS common stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be based on actual performance for any portion of a Company PSU Award that has been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time but has not yet vested. For any portion of a Company PSU Award that has not been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time, the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be based on deemed achievement of the greater of (1) maximum performance, if required by the applicable award agreement as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (2) actual performance or (3) target performance through the Effective Time.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each award of options to purchase shares of USS common stock (we refer to each such award as a “Company Option Award”) (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled, and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company Option Award to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the positive difference, if any, of the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price of such Company Option Award, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company Option Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming full vesting for any Company Option Award (or portion thereof) that is subject to performance-based vesting).

Each deferred restricted stock unit representing the right to be issued a share of USS common stock or cash valued by reference to the value of shares of USS common stock under USS’s Deferred Compensation Program for Non-Employee Directors (each such award, which we refer to as “Company DSU Award”), will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration or such other amount contemplated by the Company DSU Award and settled in accordance with the terms thereof.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 85)
The exchange of USS common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who exchanges shares of USS common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of USS common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S. Holder.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of USS common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. This description does not address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you of the Merger.
Appraisal Rights (see page 27)
If the Merger is consummated, USS stockholders who continuously hold shares of USS common stock through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, validly and properly demand appraisal of their shares of USS common stock and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares of USS common stock in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that USS stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares of USS common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of USS common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each USS stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, USS stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
USS stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of USS common stock as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as

or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to USS before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to hold your shares of USS common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (d) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the USS stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/ sc09/index.html#262) and is incorporated herein by reference. If you hold your shares of USS common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you may make a written demand for appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the conditions set forth above and your written demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares for which demand is made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or securities account statement containing such information or a letter from a broker or other record holder of such shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f) of the DGCL. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights.”

and performance of each of the covenants, obligations and liabilities of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, under the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The guaranty is one of payment and performance, not merely collection, and any breach or nonperformance of any such obligations of Merger Sub or Parent (or any of their successors or assigns) is also deemed to be a default of Guarantor. Guarantor’s obligations under the Merger Agreement are expressly limited to the Guaranteed Obligations and upon the full discharge and performance of all Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor will no longer have any duties or obligations under the Merger Agreement.
Required Stockholder Approval (see page 24)
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Merger Agreement Proposal”). As of [	], 2024 (which we refer to as the “Record Date”),
[	] votes constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock entitled to vote
thereon. Approval of the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to USS’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Compensation Proposal”) requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of USS common stock representing a majority of the votes cast by USS stockholders present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting of USS stockholders (such meeting, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting” and such proposal, which we refer to as the “Adjournment Proposal”) requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of USS common stock representing a majority of the voting power present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present. The approval of the Compensation Proposal is advisory (non-binding) and is not a condition to the completion of the Merger.
As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, [	] shares of USS common stock, representing approximately [	]% of
the shares of USS common stock outstanding as of the Record Date.
We currently expect that our directors and executive officers will vote all of their respective shares of USS common stock: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, although none of them have entered into any agreements obligating them to do so.
The Special Meeting (see page 24)
Date, Time and Location
The Special Meeting to consider and vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and, if necessary or appropriate, the Adjournment Proposal will be held virtually via live webcast on [	], 2024, beginning at [	] Eastern Time (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or
postponed). USS stockholders will be able to attend and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/[ ] (which we refer to as the “Special Meeting website”). For purposes of attendance at the Special Meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present” shall mean virtually present at the Special Meeting and all references in the enclosed proxy statement to “attend” shall mean virtually attend the Special Meeting.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote

Recommendation of the USS Board of Directors (see page 27)
The Board of Directors of USS (which we refer to as the “Board of Directors”) has unanimously: (a) determined that it is fair to and in the best interests of USS and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (b) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement by USS and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and (c) resolved to recommend that the USS stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the USS stockholders at the Special Meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc. (see page 53)
USS engaged Barclays Capital Inc. (which we refer to as “Barclays”) to act as a financial advisor with respect to pursuing strategic alternatives for USS, including a possible sale of USS, pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 24, 2023. At a special meeting of the Board of Directors held to evaluate the Merger, Barclays rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion dated December 18, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Barclays’ written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be offered to the holders of USS common stock in the Merger was fair to such holders from a financial point of view, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” beginning on page 53.
The full text of Barclays’ written opinion to the Board of Directors is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Barclays’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety.
Barclays’ opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays’ Fairness Opinion Committee, is addressed to the Board of Directors, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be offered to the holders of USS common stock and does not constitute a recommendation to any USS stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. The terms of the Merger were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between USS and NSC and were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to USS or that any specific form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Barclays was not requested to address, and its opinion does not in any manner address, USS’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the Merger, the likelihood of the consummation of the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which USS may engage. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to the holders of USS common stock in the Merger or otherwise. No limitations were imposed by the Board of Directors upon Barclays with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion. The engagement letter between USS and Barclays provides for aggregate fees of approximately $68 million in connection with the Merger, including a transaction fee of approximately $63 million upon the completion of the Merger, approximately $13 million of which was payable upon the announcement of the Merger. A $5 million fee was paid upon execution of the engagement letter between USS and Barclays for prior work performed in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between USS and Barclays also contemplated an independence fee of $22.5 million that would have been payable solely in the event that USS did not enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction by a certain date.

LLC (which we refer to as “Goldman Sachs”) rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion dated December 18, 2023 that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than NSC and its affiliates) of USS common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Non-Solicitation Covenant (see page 102)
During the period commencing on the date of the Merger Agreement and ending as of the earlier of the Effective Time or the valid termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Pre-Closing Period”), USS has agreed that it will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and agents and other representatives (which we refer to, collectively, as “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, among other things: solicit, initiate, induce, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the making or submission of, any proposal, offer, inquiry or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, an Alternative Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — NonSolicitation Covenant”); or engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions with any person regarding any proposal, offer, inquiry or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, an Alternative Proposal; or furnish any non-public information regarding USS or any of its subsidiaries or provide access to their respective operational properties to any person relating to any proposal, offer, inquiry or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, an Alternative Proposal (subject to the exceptions set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Non-Solicitation Covenant”).

During the Pre-Closing Period, USS has agreed that it will (i) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt) notify Parent of the receipt by USS or any of its subsidiaries or their respective Representatives of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, an Alternative Proposal and (ii) thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt (and, in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) basis of any material developments with respect to, or any material change to the terms of, any such Alternative Proposal, including by providing copies of any additional draft agreements relating to, or written proposals containing any material term of, any such Alternative Proposal received by USS, any of its affiliates or any of their respective Representatives.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, USS receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal which did not result from a breach of the Merger Agreement, and the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with USS’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Non-Solicitation Covenant”) and the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, USS may, among other things and subject to certain requirements, furnish information, including material non-public information, to any person making such Alternative Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to the Alternative Proposal.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Non-Solicitation Covenant.”
Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, the Board of Directors is entitled to (i) change its recommendation regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and/or to terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, to enter into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal or (ii) change its recommendation regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement in light of a continuing Intervening Event (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”), in each case, if it complies with certain procedures in the Merger Agreement, including giving Parent appropriate notice of such intention and negotiating further in good faith with Parent at Parent’s option before the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with USS’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation.”
The termination of the Merger Agreement by USS in connection with the Board of Directors’ authorization for USS to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal will result in the payment by USS of a termination fee of $565 million. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”
Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 118)
In addition to the circumstances described above, Parent and USS have certain rights to terminate the Merger Agreement under customary circumstances, including (i) by mutual agreement, (ii) if any governmental entity with competent jurisdiction over Parent or USS has issued a final and nonappealable injunction or similar order or any law that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger and the other

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q: How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of USS common stock prior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement?
A: The Merger Consideration of $55.00 per share represents a premium of approximately 142% over the closing price of USS common stock on August 11, 2023, the last full trading day prior to USS’s public announcement of its strategic alternatives review process and approximately 40% over USS’s closing stock price of $39.33 on December 15, 2023, the last trading day before public announcement of the Merger Agreement. The closing price of USS common stock on the NYSE on January 18, 2024, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, was $47.45. You are encouraged to obtain current market prices of USS common stock in connection with voting your shares of USS common stock.
Q: May I attend and vote at the Special Meeting?
A: All USS stockholders as of the Record Date may attend and vote at the Special Meeting.
Shares held directly in your name as a USS stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website. Shares held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.
Even if you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting — Voting at the Special Meeting”) so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to, or become unable to, virtually attend the Special Meeting. If you attend and vote at the Special Meeting, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.
Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $55.00 in cash, without interest, subject to any required tax withholding, for each share of USS common stock that you own (other than any Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless you have properly and validly exercised (and do not withdraw) your appraisal rights in accordance with, and have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL. For example, if you own 100 shares of USS common stock, you will receive $5,500 in cash in exchange for your shares of USS common stock (other than any Excluded Shares), without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Excluded Shares means (a) each share that is owned by USS as treasury stock or otherwise, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any shares of USS common stock held by any Company Employee Plan or trust related thereto (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under any of the Company Equity Plans) or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and (b) shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares described in the foregoing clause (a)) and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of such shares, as applicable.
Q: What will holders of Company Awards receive if the Merger is completed?
A: Pursuant to the Merger Agreement:
•	Upon completion of the Merger, each Company RSU Award, or portion thereof, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and will be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of the Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares underlying such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company RSU Award (or portion thereof);

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•	Upon completion of the Merger, each Company PSU Award, or portion thereof, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested to the extent described in the following sentence and will be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of the Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares subject to such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company PSU Award (or portion thereof). The total number of shares of USS common stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be based on actual performance for any portion of a Company PSU Award that has been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time but has not yet vested. For any portion of a Company PSU Award that has not been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time, the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be based on deemed achievement of the greater of (1) maximum performance, if required by the applicable award agreement as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (2) actual performance or (3) target performance through the Effective Time;
•	Upon completion of the Merger, each Company Option Award, or portion thereof, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and will be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company Option Award to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Company Option Award, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Option Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming full vesting for any Company Option Award (or portion thereof) that is subject to performance-based vesting). If the exercise price of any Company Option Award (whether vested or unvested) is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option Award will be cancelled without payment and will have no further force or effect; and
•	Upon completion of the Merger, each Company DSU Award will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration or such other amount contemplated by the Company DSU Award and settled in accordance with the terms thereof.
For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Merger Consideration — Treatment of USS Equity Awards.”
Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of USS common stock?
A: The exchange of USS common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) who exchanges shares of USS common stock for cash in the Merger generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of USS common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger by such U.S. Holder.
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of USS common stock for cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States, but may be subject to backup withholding tax unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification procedures or otherwise establishes a valid exemption from backup withholding tax.
This proxy statement contains a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. This description does not address any non-income tax consequences, nor does it address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax consequences or the consequences to holders who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal tax law. Consequently, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you of the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q: What vote is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?
A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock as of the Record Date is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of USS common stock representing a majority of the votes cast by USS stockholders present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to approve the Compensation Proposal. The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of USS common stock representing a majority of the voting power present or represented by proxy, whether or not a quorum is present, is required for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
The failure of any USS stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed proxy card; (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting — Voting at the Special Meeting”); or (c) attend the Special Meeting will, assuming a quorum is present, have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal, and, whether or not a quorum is present, will have no effect the Adjournment Proposal other than reducing the number of affirmative votes required to achieve a majority for such matter by reducing the total number of shares of USS common stock from which the majority is calculated. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present at the Special Meeting. If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q: What constitutes a quorum?
A: The holders of one-third of the voting power of the outstanding shares of USS common stock entitled to vote on the Record Date and present or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. Because there were [	] shares of USS common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote as of the Record Date, we will need holders of at least [	] shares present or
represented by proxy at the Special Meeting to achieve a quorum.
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by USS stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, USS stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of USS common stock. Instead, USS will remain an independent public company, USS common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and the CSE and registered under the Exchange Act, and USS will continue to file periodic and other reports with the SEC.
Under specified circumstances, USS will be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $565 million upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.” Under specified circumstances relating to the failure to obtain Required Approvals, Parent will be required to pay USS a termination fee of $565 million upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees.”
Q: Why are USS stockholders being asked to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Compensation Proposal?
A: The Exchange Act and applicable SEC rules thereunder require USS to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to certain payments that could become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q: What will happen if USS stockholders do not approve the Compensation Proposal at the Special Meeting?
A: Approval of the Compensation Proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to the Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on USS. Therefore, if the approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal is obtained and the Merger is completed, the amounts payable under the Compensation Proposal will continue to be payable to USS’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements regardless of whether the Compensation Proposal is approved.
Q: What do I need to do now?
A: You should carefully read and consider this entire proxy statement and the annexes to this proxy statement, including the Merger Agreement, along with all of the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, as they contain important information about, among other things, the Merger and how it affects you. Then complete, date, sign and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting — Voting at the Special Meeting”), so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.
Q: May I exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger?
A: Yes. If the Merger is consummated, USS stockholders who continuously hold shares of USS common stock through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and validly and properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that USS stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal and follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares of USS common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of USS common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each USS stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, USS stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
Q: Should I surrender my certificates or book-entry shares of USS common stock now?
A: No. After the Merger is completed, the Paying Agent (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures”) will, as soon as reasonably practical after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than two business days following the Closing Date, send each holder of record of USS common stock represented by certificates, whose shares of USS common stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal and (B) instructions that explain how to surrender certificates or book-entry shares of USS common stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of USS common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting?
A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of USS common stock after

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Record Date but before the Special Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of USS common stock and each of you notifies USS in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of USS common stock, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of USS common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting — Voting at the Special Meeting”).
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a USS stockholder of record and holding shares in “street name” as a beneficial owner?
A: If your shares of USS common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered to be the “stockholder of record” with respect to those shares. In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by USS.
If your shares of USS common stock are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of USS common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the USS stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to vote on the Internet, by telephone or, if you received a paper copy of the proxy materials, by completing, signing and mailing the proxy card enclosed therewith in the postage-prepaid envelope provided for that purpose.
Q: How may I vote?
A: If you are a USS stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of USS common stock are registered in your name with EQ Shareowner Services, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:
•	Internet: Vote at [	] in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system is
available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on [	], 2024. Once you enter the
Internet voting system, you can record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
•	Telephone: Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours a day in the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on [	], 2024. Once
you enter the telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
•	Mail: Mark your voting instructions on the card and complete, date, sign and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before [	] on [	], 2024.
•	At the Special Meeting: Shares of USS common stock held directly in your name as a USS stockholder of record may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website. Shares of USS common stock held in “street name” may be voted at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website only if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee.
If your shares of USS common stock are held “in street name” by a bank, broker or other nominee, the holder of your shares will provide you with a copy of this proxy statement, a voting instruction form and directions on how to provide voting instructions. These directions may allow you to vote over the Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that your bank, broker or other nominee may require that you inform them earlier than required by the proxy card in order for your vote to be submitted.
Whether or not you plan to attend the virtual Special Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. We encourage you to submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone, both of which are convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning a proxy card by mail. You may still attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat if you have already voted by proxy.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares of USS common stock, if you vote electronically over the Internet by visiting the address on your proxy card or by telephone by calling the phone number on your proxy card, in each case, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
If your shares of USS common stock are held in USS’s 401(k) plan, you may instruct the plan trustee on how to vote your shares in the 401(k) plan online, by mail, or by telephone as described above for shares held of record, except that if you vote by mail, then the card you use will be a voting instruction form rather than a proxy card. In addition, your vote will apply to a proportionate number of other shares held by participants in the 401(k) plan for which voting directions are not received. All participants are fiduciaries under the terms of the 401(k) plan and under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) for the limited purpose of voting shares credited to their accounts. Under ERISA, fiduciaries are required to act prudently in making voting decisions.
Q: What is a proxy?
A: A proxy is a USS stockholder’s legal designation of another person to vote shares of USS common stock owned by such USS stockholder on their behalf. If you are a USS stockholder of record, or beneficially in street name, you can vote by proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. If you hold shares of USS common stock beneficially in “street name,” you should follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.
Q: If a USS stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares of USS common stock voted?
A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, or your proxies, will vote your shares of USS common stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of USS common stock should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares of USS common stock represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Q: If my broker holds my shares of USS common stock in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares of USS common stock on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares of USS common stock. Without instructions, your shares of USS common stock will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Q: What is a “broker non-vote”?
A: A “broker non-vote” results when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. USS does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine,” whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is considered “nonroutine.” As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of USS common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your

TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
A: Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy before the Special Meeting in the manner described in this proxy statement. If you are the record holder of your shares of USS common stock, you may change or revoke your proxy by any of the following actions:
•	Notifying our Corporate Secretary in writing at 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219;
•	Completing, dating, signing and returning a later dated proxy card;
•	Submitting a new proxy electronically via the Internet or by telephone; or
•	Voting at the Special Meeting. Please note that virtual attendance at the Special Meeting will not by itself constitute revocation of a proxy.
Any change to your proxy that is provided by telephone or the Internet must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on [	], 2024.
If you hold your shares of USS common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the Special Meeting via the Special Meeting website.
If you have any questions about how to vote or change your vote, you should contact our proxy solicitor:

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
A: This means you own shares of USS common stock that are registered under different names or are in more than one account. For example, you may own some shares of USS common stock directly as a USS stockholder of record and other shares of USS common stock through a broker, or you may own shares of USS common stock through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You must vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the proxy cards that you receive in order to vote all of the shares of USS common stock you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope. If you submit your proxy by mail, make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.
Q: How many copies of this proxy statement and related voting materials should I receive if I share an address with another USS stockholder?
A: The SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more USS stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement to those USS stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for USS stockholders and cost savings for companies.
USS and some brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single set of proxy materials to multiple USS stockholders who request a copy and share an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected USS stockholders. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if your

household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify our Corporate Secretary at 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, (412) 433-4804, or, if the latter, you may also contact your broker or other nominee record holder.
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
A: The preliminary voting results for the Special Meeting are expected to be announced at the Special Meeting. In addition, within four business days following certification of the final voting results, USS will file the final voting results of the Special Meeting (or, if the final voting results have not yet been certified, the preliminary results) with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
A: USS has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated, which we refer to as “Innisfree,” to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. USS estimates that it will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $50,000, plus reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket fees and expenses. USS has agreed to indemnify Innisfree against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions). USS also may reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries or their respective agents for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of USS common stock. USS directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by telephone, by electronic means or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.
Q: What will happen to USS’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“Company DRIP”) in the Merger?
A: On December 17, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the suspension of the Company DRIP until further notice, as required pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Company DRIP was thereafter suspended as of December 19, 2023. As a result, any distributions declared by USS after December 17, 2023 will be paid in cash to all USS stockholders unless and until the Company DRIP is reinstated. Participants in the Company DRIP also will not be permitted to purchase shares of USS common stock through optional cash investments under the Company DRIP. The suspension of the Company DRIP will not affect the participants’ ability to sell any shares of USS common stock held under the Company DRIP acquired before December 17, 2023.
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
A: We currently expect the Merger to be completed in the second or third quarter of 2024. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement and summarized in this proxy statement, many of which are outside of our control.
Q: How can I obtain additional information about USS?
A: USS will provide copies of this proxy statement, documents incorporated by reference and its 2023 Annual Report to Stockholders, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (which we refer to as “Annual Report”), without charge to any USS stockholder who makes a request in writing to our Corporate Secretary at 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219. In order for you to receive timely delivery of documents in advance of the Special Meeting, you must make such request by no later than [	], 2024. USS’s Annual Report and other
SEC filings may also be accessed at https://sec.gov or on USS’s Investor website at https:// investors.ussteel.com/. USS’s website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated in this proxy statement by this or any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement contains information regarding USS that may constitute “forward-looking statements,” as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws, that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We intend the forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in those sections. Generally, we have identified such forward-looking statements by using the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “target,” “forecast,” “aim,” “should,” “plan,” “goal,” “future,” “will,” “may” and similar expressions or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, statements expressing general views about future operating or financial results, operating or financial performance, trends, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, anticipated cost savings, potential capital and operational cash improvements and changes in the global economic environment. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts, but instead represent only USS’s beliefs regarding future goals, plans and expectations about our prospects for the future and other events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of USS’s control, as well as statements regarding the proposed transaction and the timing of the completion of the transaction. It is possible that USS’s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Management of USS believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the time made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. In addition, forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from USS’s historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation:
•	the ability of the parties to consummate the proposed transaction on a timely basis or at all;
•	the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals of the proposed transaction that could cause the parties to terminate the Merger Agreement;
•	the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;
•	the possibility that USS’s stockholders may not approve the proposed transaction;
•	the risks and uncertainties related to securing the necessary stockholder approval;
•	the risk that the parties to the Merger Agreement may not be able to satisfy the conditions to the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all;
•	risks related to disruption and distraction of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transaction;
•	certain restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact USS’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions;
•	the risk that any announcements relating to the proposed transaction could have adverse effects on the market price of USS’s common stock;
•	the risk of any unexpected costs or expenses resulting from the proposed transaction;
•	the risk of any litigation relating to the proposed transaction; and
•	the risk that the proposed transaction and its announcement could have an adverse effect on the ability of USS to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and other business relationships and on its operating results and business generally.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
THE SPECIAL MEETING
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors for use at the Special Meeting.
Date, Time and Place
The Special Meeting will be held virtually via live webcast on [	], 2024, beginning at [	] Eastern
Time (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed). USS stockholders will be able to attend and vote at the Special Meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/[ ] (which we refer to as the “Special Meeting website”).
Purpose of the Special Meeting
At the Special Meeting, we will ask USS stockholders to vote on proposals to: (a) adopt the Merger Agreement Proposal; (b) approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal; and (c) approve the Adjournment Proposal.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
Only USS stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. A list of USS stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at our principal executive offices located at 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, during regular business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were [	] shares of USS common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting.
Holders of one-third of the voting power of the outstanding shares of USS common stock entitled to vote on the Record Date present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, it is expected that the Special Meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
Each USS stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of USS common stock owned at the close of business on the Record Date.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal. As of the Record Date, [	] shares constitute a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock. Adoption of the
Merger Agreement by USS stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the Merger.
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of USS common stock representing a majority of the votes cast by USS stockholders present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of USS common stock representing a majority of the voting power present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, is required for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
The failure of any USS stockholder of record to: (a) submit a signed proxy card; (b) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone (in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting — Voting at the Special Meeting”); or (c) attend the Special Meeting will, assuming a quorum is present, have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal and, whether or not a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal other than reducing the number of affirmative votes required to achieve a majority for such matter by reducing the total number of shares of USS common stock from which the majority is calculated. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, for USS stockholders who attend the Special Meeting or are represented by proxy and abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the USS stockholder voted “AGAINST” the Merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Agreement Proposal but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present at the Special Meeting.
Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal and, regardless of whether a quorum is present, will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal. A so-called “broker non-vote” occurs when banks, brokers and other nominees return a valid proxy voting upon a matter or matters for which the applicable rules provide discretionary authority but do not vote on a particular proposal because they do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. USS does not expect any broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because the rules applicable to banks, brokers and other nominees only provide brokers with discretionary authority to vote on proposals that are considered “routine,” whereas each of the proposals to be presented at the Special Meeting is expected to be considered “non-routine.” As a result, no broker will be permitted to vote your shares of USS common stock at the Special Meeting without receiving instructions. Failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, but will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
Stock Ownership and Interests of Certain Persons
Shares Held by USS’s Directors and Executive Officers
As of the Record Date, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, [	] shares of USS common stock, representing approximately [	]% of the
shares of USS common stock outstanding on the Record Date.
We currently expect that our executive officers and directors will vote all of their respective shares of USS common stock (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal, (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, although none of them have entered into any agreements obligating them to do so.
Voting at the Special Meeting
You can vote at the virtual Special Meeting, which will be held on [	], 2024, at [	] Eastern Time
at [	] (unless the Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed).
You may also authorize the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares by returning the proxy card in advance by mail, over the Internet or by telephone. Although USS offers multiple voting methods, USS encourages you to vote over the Internet or by phone as USS believes they are the most cost-effective methods. We also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the Special Meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective and reliable alternatives to returning your proxy card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares over the Internet or by telephone, there is no need for you to submit your proxy card by mail.
To Vote Over the Internet:
Vote at [	] in advance of the Special Meeting. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours per
day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on [	], 2024. Once you enter the Internet voting system, you can
record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.
To Vote by Telephone:
Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours per day in the United States until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on [	], 2024. Once you enter the
telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
To Vote by Proxy Card:
If you received a proxy card, mark your voting instructions on the card and sign, date and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided. For your mailed proxy card to be counted, we must receive it before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on [	], 2024.
All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received by the deadline indicated above will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the USS stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal. If you indicate on your proxy card that you wish to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal but do not indicate a choice on the Adjournment Proposal or the Compensation Proposal on an advisory (non-binding) basis, your shares of USS common stock will be voted “FOR” each such proposal. Proxy cards that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the Special Meeting and cannot be voted and therefore will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal.
If your shares of USS common stock are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending the Special Meeting and voting using your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control number, contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number so that you may vote. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote thereat, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal but, assuming a quorum is present, will not have any effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal (so long as you do not attend the Special Meeting and abstain from voting on any given proposal, which would have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal, but would have no effect on the Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, as applicable).
If your shares of USS common stock are held in USS’s 401(k) plan, you may instruct the plan trustee on how to vote your shares in the 401(k) plan online, by mail, or by telephone as described above for shares held of record, except that if you vote by mail, then the card you use will be a voting instruction form rather than a proxy card. In addition, your vote will apply to a proportionate number of other shares held by participants in the 401(k) plan for which voting directions are not received. All participants are fiduciaries under the terms of the 401(k) plan and under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) for the limited purpose of voting shares credited to their accounts. Under ERISA, fiduciaries are required to act prudently in making voting decisions.
Revocability of Proxies
Any proxy given by a USS stockholder may be revoked before the Special Meeting by doing any of the following:
•	if a proxy was submitted by telephone or over the Internet, by submitting another proxy by telephone or over the Internet, in accordance with the instructions detailed in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Special Meeting — Voting at the Special Meeting” at any time before the closing of the voting facilities at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on [	], 2024;
•	by submitting a properly completed, dated and signed proxy card with a date later than the date of the previously submitted proxy relating to the same shares of USS common stock, provided such proxy card is received no later than the close of business on [	], 2024;
•	by delivering a signed written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of the proxy to USS’s Corporate Secretary at 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, stating that the proxy is revoked, provided such written notice is received no later than the close of business on [	], 2024; or

•	by attending the virtual Special Meeting and voting thereat (your attendance at the virtual Special Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy).
If you hold your shares of USS common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote at the virtual Special Meeting with your control number, or, if you did not obtain a control number, by contacting your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a control number.
Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Special Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, will allow USS stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.
Board of Directors’ Recommendation
The Board of Directors has unanimously: (a) determined that it fair to and in the best interests of USS and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (b) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement by USS and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and (c) resolved to recommend that the USS stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration of the USS stockholders at the Special Meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.
Solicitation of Proxies
The Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy, and USS will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Innisfree has been retained to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree will be paid approximately $50,000 and will be reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these and other advisory services in connection with the Special Meeting. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians and other like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of USS common stock, in which case these parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in accordance with SEC and NYSE regulations. Proxies may also be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic medium by USS or, without additional compensation, by USS or USS’s directors, officers and employees.
Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger
Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by USS stockholders of the Merger Agreement Proposal, we currently anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the second or third quarter of 2024.
Appraisal Rights
If the Merger is consummated, USS stockholders who continuously hold shares of USS common stock through the Effective Time, do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and validly and properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that USS stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares of USS common stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of USS common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any (or in certain circumstances described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights,” on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger to each USS stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of

judgment in any appraisal proceeding). Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, USS stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to review Section 262 of the DGCL carefully and to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.
USS stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of USS common stock as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of USS common stock.
To exercise your appraisal rights, you must: (a) submit a written demand for appraisal to USS before the vote is taken on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; (c) continue to hold your shares of USS common stock of record through the Effective Time; and (d) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of the Merger unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the USS stockholders seeking appraisal. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights,” which is qualified in its entirety by Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/ sc09/index.html#262) and is incorporated herein by reference. If you hold your shares of USS common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you may make a written demand for appraisal in your own name, but you must satisfy the conditions set forth above and your written demand must also reasonably identify the holder of record of the shares of USS common stock for which demand is made, be accompanied by documentary evidence of your beneficial ownership of stock (such as a brokerage or securities account statement containing such information or a letter from a broker or other record holder of such shares confirming such information) and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provide an address at which you consent to receive notices given by the surviving corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the verified list required by Section 262(f) of the DGCL. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Appraisal Rights.”
Delisting and Deregistration of USS Common Stock
If the Merger is completed, the shares of USS common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and the CSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and shares of USS common stock will no longer be publicly traded.
Other Matters
Pursuant to the DGCL and USS’s by-laws, only the matters set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting may be brought before the Special Meeting.

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company PSU Award (or portion thereof).

Background of the Merger
The Board of Directors and USS senior management regularly review and assess USS’s industry, financial performance, prospects and long-term strategic plan with the goal of enhancing stockholder value. As part of this ongoing process, the Board of Directors and USS senior management have periodically evaluated potential strategic alternatives relating to USS and its business, including with respect to USS’s USSE segment during the period preceding announcement of the Merger. These evaluations took into account the perspectives of the Company’s stockholders, whose views were sought through the Company’s stockholder engagement program. From time to time, USS’s financial advisors, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Evercore Group L.L.C. (which we refer to as “Evercore”), which have each historically provided financial advisory services to the Company, have assisted in this strategic alternatives review process.
In addition, USS has engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential strategic transactions, including possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, business combinations and mergers. Members of USS’s senior management team from time to time have met or otherwise communicated informally and independently with representatives of peer companies at industry events and elsewhere regarding industry trends and the performance, business, strategic direction and prospects of their respective companies. USS is generally familiar with the businesses and operations of its peer companies, and have from time to time informally discussed potential business transactions with representatives of peer companies , but no specific terms of a potential transaction between such parties were negotiated during these informal communications.
On March 9, 2023, a representative from Company A reached out to David Burritt, the President and Chief Executive Officer of USS, requesting a meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A.
On March 16, 2023, USS entered into a limited confidentiality agreement with Company A covering the anticipated meeting between USS and Company A, which was scheduled for March 20, 2023. USS senior management met with representatives from Barclays and Milbank LLP (which we refer to as “Milbank”), USS’s outside legal counsel, at various times between March 16 and March 20, 2023 to prepare for the meeting with Company A.
On March 20, 2023, the Chief Executive Officer and a member of the management team of Company A and members of the USS management team, including Mr. Burritt, met in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During the meeting, Company A proposed exploring a joint venture between USS and Company A relating to certain of USS’s North American assets and certain of Company A’s North American assets. The proposal, which subsequently was shared with the Board of Directors, did not include any financial terms. On March 23, 2023, a representative of USS informed a representative of Company A that USS had carefully considered the proposal and concluded that it was not in the best interests of USS.
On June 20, 2023, a representative of Company A contacted a representative of USS to request a meeting to discuss a revised proposal.
That same day, a representative of a consortium unrelated to Company A, which included a private company, a publicly traded company and a financial sponsor (which we refer to, collectively, as “Consortium B”) contacted USS to request a meeting with Mr. Burritt, which was not scheduled.
On June 30, 2023, Consortium B submitted to USS an unsolicited, non-binding, preliminary written proposal to acquire USS’s North American Flat-Rolled (which we refer to as “NAFR”) and USSE segments for $3.45 billion in cash (which we refer to as the “June 30 Consortium B Proposal”). That same day, USS entered into a limited confidentiality agreement with Company A covering an anticipated meeting between USS and Company A, scheduled for July 13, 2023.
On July 3, 2023, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, and Milbank participated. Barclays and Goldman Sachs were selected by USS as financial advisors to USS based on each institution’s reputation, experience and knowledge of the industrials industry and experience advising companies in mergers and acquisitions. The Board of Directors reviewed the June 30 Consortium B Proposal and discussed the upcoming Company A meeting. Duane Holloway, the General Counsel of USS, and a representative of Milbank advised the Board of Directors of their fiduciary duties and other relevant legal matters in connection therewith. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs then discussed with the Board of Directors certain preliminary observations and perspectives regarding the financial aspects of the June 30 Consortium B Proposal and representatives of Barclays reviewed a preliminary financial analysis with respect to the June 30 Consortium B Proposal. At that meeting, after consultation with representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Milbank, the Board of Directors directed USS senior management, Barclays and Goldman Sachs to contact Consortium B to clarify certain aspects of the June 30 Consortium B Proposal and report back to the Board of Directors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On July 6, 2023, members of USS senior management, along with representatives of Barclays, contacted Consortium B, as directed by the Board of Directors, to clarify certain aspects of the June 30 Consortium B Proposal.
On July 13, 2023, Mr. Burritt, Jessica Graziano, the Chief Financial Officer of USS, and Richard Fruehauf, Senior Vice President, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of USS, met with the Chief Executive Officer and a member of the management team of Company A in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During that meeting, Company A indicated that it planned to deliver a letter proposing an all-cash offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock and that such offer would not include a financing contingency. Financial terms of the proposal were not provided by Company A during the meeting.
On July 14, 2023, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Milbank participated. The Board of Directors reviewed the June 30 Consortium B Proposal and discussed USS’s recent interactions with Company A, including the July 13, 2023 meeting and the anticipated Company A proposal. Representatives of Milbank provided an overview of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties and other relevant legal matters in connection therewith. Members of USS management summarized the July 6, 2023 conversation with representatives of Consortium B, including the clarifications provided by Consortium B, and the July 13 discussion with representatives of Company A. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs then discussed with the Board of Directors certain preliminary observations and perspectives regarding the financial aspects of the June 30 Consortium B Proposal and reviewed a preliminary financial analysis with respect to the June 30 Consortium B Proposal. Following discussion with representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Milbank, the Board of Directors directed USS senior management, Barclays and Goldman Sachs to convey to representatives of Consortium B USS’s view as to a potential scope of any asset sale transaction with Consortium B that USS might determine to consider (which assets would exclude USS’s Minntac and Keetac mining operations) negotiate and enter into a confidentiality agreement with Consortium B in order to share confidential information regarding the Company to facilitate a proposal for USS’s preferred transaction scope, and to request that Consortium B provide an updated proposal with respect to USS’s preferred transaction scope.
On July 17, 2023, USS received an unsolicited written, non-binding indication of interest from Company A proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock at a price of $31.50 per share in cash (which we refer to as the “July 17 Company A Proposal”), which noted that the proposal was not subject to any financing condition, that Company A would be able to expeditiously complete due diligence and negotiate a mutually agreeable merger agreement in parallel, and that Company A’s outside legal counsel had conducted a preliminary antitrust review of the potential combination with USS and expressed confidence in Company A’s ability to identify clear pathways to procure all applicable regulatory approvals.
On July 19, 2023, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually to review the July 17 Company A Proposal, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Milbank participated. Mr. Holloway provided a review of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties and other relevant legal matters in connection therewith. During that meeting, members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs summarized recent discussions with Consortium B relating to the June 30 Consortium B Proposal. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs then provided a preliminary review, based on publicly available information, with respect to the financial aspects of the July 17 Company A Proposal and responded to feedback from members of USS senior management and the Board of Directors. Representatives of Milbank commented that the July 17 Company A Proposal presented certain regulatory risks, including substantial execution risk under U.S. antitrust laws, that should be considered as part of the overall assessment of that proposal. It was noted, at the request of the Board of Directors, that Barclays and Goldman Sachs would prepare a review of potential alternatives for the Company to be presented at an upcoming meeting of the Board of Directors scheduled for the following week.
On July 21, 2023, Goldman Sachs delivered to USS a relationship disclosure letter, which was later shared with the Board of Directors, providing certain information regarding Goldman Sachs’ relationships with Company A and Consortium B. Such relationship disclosure letter was subsequently updated from time to time, including with respect to other bidders, and shared with the Board of Directors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
From July 23 to July 25, 2023, USS held a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors at USS headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During the July 24, 2023 session, the Board of Directors met with members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Milbank to discuss potential alternatives, including USS’s standalone strategic plan, the unsolicited June 30 Consortium B Proposal, the July 17 Company A Proposal and other potential transactions that could be pursued by the Company. A representative of Milbank provided a review of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties and the relevant legal matters in connection therewith, and members of USS senior management provided an update on conversations relating to the June 30 Consortium B Proposal, including that a confidentiality agreement between USS and Consortium B was in near-final form. Members of USS senior management then presented an overview of USS’s then-current standalone ten-year strategic plan, including unaudited prospective financial information for USS, as further described in the section of this proxy statement titled “Certain Financial Projections.” Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs provided the Board of Directors with an overview of potential strategic alternatives for the Company as well as their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to the financial aspects of each of the July 17 Company A Proposal and the June 30 Consortium B Proposal. A representative of Milbank advised the Board of Directors that the July 17 Company A Proposal presented certain regulatory risks, including substantial execution risk under U.S. antitrust laws. At that meeting, after careful review and deliberation with the members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Milbank present at the meeting of the Board of Directors, and taking into account the preliminary financial analysis prepared by Barclays and Goldman Sachs, the Board of Directors unanimously determined that the July 17 Company A Proposal was not in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders and directed Mr. Burritt to inform the Chief Executive Officer of Company A of such determination.
On July 24, 2023, USS entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement with Consortium B.
On July 27, 2023, Barclays delivered to USS a relationship disclosure letter, which was later shared with the Board of Directors, providing certain information regarding Barclays’ relationships with Company A and Consortium B. Such relationship disclosure letter was subsequently updated from time to time, including with respect to other bidders, and shared with the Board of Directors.
On July 28, 2023, USS announced its earnings for the second fiscal quarter of 2023, including an update on USS’s Best For All® strategy. Among other items, USS disclosed that its ongoing strategic projects remained on track and fully funded and that USS was prioritizing direct returns to stockholders consistent with its capital allocation framework.
On July 28, 2023, Mr. Burritt received a phone call from Lourenco Goncalves, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (which we refer to as “Cleveland-Cliffs”), indicating that Cleveland-Cliffs would be submitting a proposal for a transaction with USS. Shortly after that call, Mr. Burritt and the Board Chair of USS, David Sutherland, received an unsolicited, non-binding letter from Cleveland-Cliffs proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock at a price of $35.00 per share, to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in Cleveland-Cliffs’ stock (which we refer to as the “July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal”). The letter stated that a response was required by August 7, 2023.
On August 2, 2023, Mr. Burritt contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to convey that the Board of Directors had unanimously determined that the July 17 Company A Proposal was not in the best interests of USS stockholders.
On August 3, 2023, the Board of Directors, with members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Milbank and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, outside legal counsel to USS (which we refer to as “Wachtell”), present, held a special meeting of the Board of Directors virtually to review the July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal. Mr. Holloway provided a review of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties and other relevant legal matters. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs then provided their respective preliminary financial analyses with respect to the July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal, reviewed the financial aspects of each of the June 30 Consortium B Proposal, the July 17 Company A Proposal and the July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal, and provided an overview of other potential alternatives for USS. Representatives of Milbank discussed certain regulatory considerations with respect to the July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal, including their views, based on publicly available information, that a combination with Cleveland-Cliffs posed substantial execution risk under U.S. antitrust laws.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
discussion with members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Milbank and Wachtell, the Board of Directors directed members of USS senior management and Barclays and Goldman Sachs to seek clarification from Cleveland-Cliffs with respect to the proposed exchange ratio contemplated by the July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal, as well as the anticipated transaction synergies, the intrinsic value of Cleveland-Cliffs’ stock portion of the proposed consideration and regulatory risk. The Board of Directors also directed members of USS senior management, Barclays and Goldman Sachs to continue to work with Consortium B so that Consortium B would be in a position to submit a revised proposal, and to identify other potential parties that may be interested in a potential acquisition of parts or all of USS and/or other strategic alternatives.
On August 4, 2023, representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs contacted representatives of Cleveland-Cliffs’ financial advisor, to seek clarification from Cleveland-Cliffs with respect to the proposed exchange ratio, intrinsic value and anticipated transaction synergies, and to request that legal counsel for both parties discuss the potential antitrust risk associated with a potential transaction.
On August 5, 2023, Mr. Holloway and representatives of Milbank spoke with James Graham, Cleveland-Cliffs’ General Counsel, and representatives of Cleveland-Cliffs’ outside legal counsel to discuss antitrust considerations in connection with the July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal. Also on August 5, 2023, Cleveland-Cliffs provided USS with a letter from the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (which we refer to as the “USW”) in support of the July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal.
On August 7, 2023, Mr. Burritt sent a letter to Mr. Goncalves requesting that USS and Cleveland-Cliffs enter into a customary confidentiality agreement, including a standstill, in order for the Board of Directors to be able to evaluate the July 28 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal.
On August 11, 2023, Mr. Goncalves sent USS a letter stating that Cleveland-Cliffs was (i) unwilling to sign a confidentiality agreement and (ii) proposing consideration of $17.50 in cash and 1.023 shares of Cleveland-Cliffs per share of USS common stock (which we refer to as the “August 11 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal”), valued at $32.54 per share based on the closing price of Cleveland-Cliffs’ common stock on August 10, 2023. The letter also required a response by August 13, 2023.
Later on August 11, 2023, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Milbank, Wachtell and Joele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher, USS’s communications advisor (which we refer to as “Joele Frank”), participated. A representative of Milbank provided an overview of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties and other relevant legal matters. Members of USS management and representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs then summarized recent discussions with Cleveland-Cliffs’ financial advisors and legal counsel. Representatives of the financial and legal advisors then discussed the August 11 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal. At that meeting, following discussion, and after taking into consideration the information provided by and discussed with USS senior management and representatives of the financial and legal advisors, the Board of Directors determined that it was unable to fully and adequately assess the August 11 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal without more information from Cleveland-Cliffs and therefore determined to reject the August 11 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal based on, among other things, a lack of detailed information needed to evaluate that proposal, Cleveland-Cliffs’ unwillingness to enter into a confidentiality agreement and the receipt by USS of indications of interest from other bidders. The Board of Directors then authorized an exploration of a strategic alternatives review process and directed USS senior management to publicly announce the process. The Board of Directors also instructed USS senior management to inform Cleveland-Cliffs that the August 11 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal was not in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders, and to invite Cleveland-Cliffs to participate in USS’s strategic alternatives review process.
At noon on August 13, 2023, USS publicly announced the Board of Directors’ determination to review strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. Members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, contacted representatives of Consortium B and Company A to discuss the strategic alternatives review process and to invite them to participate. USS also sent Cleveland-Cliffs a written rejection of the August 11 Cleveland-Cliffs Proposal as directed by the Board of Directors. Mr. Burritt also called Mr. Thomas Conway, the then-president of the USW, to notify the USW of the Board of Directors’ determination to review strategic alternatives.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the afternoon of August 13, 2023, Cleveland-Cliffs issued a press release announcing its offer to acquire USS on the same terms previously communicated to USS on August 11, 2023.
On August 14, 2023, Esmark Inc. (which we refer to as “Esmark”) issued a press release announcing “a voluntary public cash and exchange offer” for shares of USS common stock at a price of $35 per share of USS common stock, subject to regulatory and antitrust clearances.
On August 14, 2023, representatives of Company C contacted representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs to express their interest in participating in USS’s strategic alternatives review process. That same day, Mr. Burritt and the Chief Executive Officer of Company C had a discussion via telephone during which the Chief Executive Officer of Company C expressed interest in participating in USS’s strategic alternatives review process.
On August 15, 2023, Cleveland-Cliffs sent a letter to USS proposing to reengage on the confidentiality agreement, permit antitrust counsel to agree on an information-sharing protocol and enable the companies’ respective financial advisors to facilitate sharing of the companies’ business and financial plans.
On August 16, 2023, representatives from USS senior management and Barclays met with representatives of Consortium B in New York City to discuss the operations of the USS assets within the scope of a potential transaction.
On August 17, 2023, in order to provide clarity regarding how the USW’s basic labor agreements (which we refer to, collectively, as the “Basic Labor Agreement”) related to USS’s strategic alternatives review process, USS filed a Current Report on Form 8-K furnishing the Basic Labor Agreement and certain other related materials. The disclosure clarified that the Basic Labor Agreement does not provide the USW with a right to veto a transaction that may result from USS’s strategic alternatives review, but does provide the USW with successorship rights and a right to bid within 45 days of delivery of notice pursuant to the Basic Labor Agreement. The materials also reiterated that USS was conducting a thorough strategic alternatives review process and the Board of Directors was committed to evaluating all proposals on a level playing field to determine the best outcome for stockholders.
Later on August 17, 2023, Mr. Conway sent Mr. Burritt a letter via email stating that the USW had transferred and assigned to Cleveland-Cliffs the rights granted to the USW pursuant to the Basic Labor Agreement’s “right to bid” provisions (which we refer to as the “Right to Bid Assignment”). The letter noted that Mr. Conway would advise Mr. Burritt in writing should anything change regarding the Right to Bid Assignment. Cleveland-Cliffs issued a press release announcing the Right to Bid Assignment and subsequently filed a copy of the assignment with the SEC.
Also on August 17, 2023, representatives of Consortium B emailed Mr. Fruehauf to request the ability to expand its proposal to include the possibility of a whole-company proposal or other alternative structures.
In addition to responding to potential strategic and financial counterparties who contacted USS and representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs to express interest in USS, on August 18, 2023, representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, began outreach to additional potentially interested parties to solicit interest in a transaction involving USS, including NSC. During the process, representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs contacted or were contacted by 54 separate potential counterparties to a potential strategic transaction with USS, including 31 potential strategic parties and 23 potential financial parties.
From mid-August 2023, through the end of September 2023, representatives of Milbank, on behalf of USS, negotiated confidentiality agreements with various potential counterparties, including NSC, which executed a mutual confidentiality agreement with USS on August 26, 2023, Company A, Company C, Company D and other potential strategic and financial counterparties. During the process, USS entered into confidentiality agreements with 19 potential counterparties. Certain of the confidentiality agreements included standstill provisions for specified periods of time. With respect to Company A, Consortium B, Company C and Company D, those standstills terminated at or prior to the announcement of the merger agreement with NSC.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
On August 21, 2023, USS received a revised, non-binding proposal from Consortium B reconfirming its offer of $3.45 billion to acquire USS’s NAFR and USSE segments or, alternatively, an offer of $3.0 billion to acquire the same assets, other than USS’s Keetac mining operations.
On August 23, 2023, Esmark announced in a press release that it would not participate in the Company’s strategic alternative review process.
On August 25, 2023, USS held an information session for its Board of Directors regarding the strategic alternative review process, during which representatives of USS senior management, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Milbank and Wachtell participated. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs provided an update on the strategic alternatives review process, including on discussions with potentially interested parties.
On August 26, 2023, USS and Company D entered into a one-way confidentiality agreement providing for the disclosure of confidential information regarding Company D to USS. That same day, USS and Company D entered into a joint defense agreement to permit the exchange of information necessary to progress the analysis of the antitrust risk associated with a potential acquisition of USS by Company D. During the period from August 26, 2023 through mid-December 2023, representatives of Milbank and outside legal counsel for Company D discussed regularly and shared information necessary to analyze antitrust risk associated with a potential combination of USS and Company D.
On August 28, 2023, USS publicly released a letter to its stockholders stating that it had entered into confidentiality agreements with third parties and was beginning to share due diligence information with potential counterparties.
Beginning on August 29, 2023, parties that had signed confidentiality agreements were provided access to an electronic dataroom containing a confidential information memorandum regarding USS and certain non-public financial information regarding USS, including the first six years of the Management Base Plan (i.e., 2023 through 2028) (as defined in the section of this proxy statement titled “Certain Financial Projections”). See “Certain Financial Projections” for additional information on the financial projections provided to potential counterparties as part of the USS strategic alternatives review process.
Beginning on August 30, 2023, potential counterparties to a strategic transaction were provided with a process letter specifying that initial indications of interest should be submitted to Barclays and Goldman Sachs on September 20, 2023.
On September 1, 2023, USS received an unsolicited, non-binding letter from Company D proposing to acquire USS for $23.00 in cash and 1.023 shares of Company D common stock per share of USS common stock (which we refer to as the “Company D September 1 Proposal”), valued at $38.64 per share based on the closing price of Company D common stock on August 31, 2023. The Company D September 1 Proposal was accompanied by a form of merger agreement that disclaimed any obligation to commit to divestitures necessary to obtain regulatory approval, and did not propose a reverse termination fee payable to USS in the event of a failure to obtain regulatory approval (which we refer to as a “reverse termination fee”).
On September 5, 2023, USS sent a letter to the USW and Cleveland-Cliffs formally notifying them, in compliance with notice obligations under the Basic Labor Agreement, that USS had initiated a formal review process to evaluate strategic alternatives for USS aimed at maximizing stockholder value. The letter also confirmed that, in compliance with the “right to bid” provisions of the Basic Labor Agreement, the USW was entitled to a 45-day period to submit a bid for USS, and that USS would not enter into any transaction agreement for 45 days following September 5, 2023. The letter also attached a form of confidentiality agreement consistent with the form provided to other bidders and noted that, subject to execution of the confidentiality agreement, USS would provide the USW with information provided to other potential bidders and updates on the strategic alternatives review process. No confidentiality agreement was ever signed with the USW. The letter further noted that Cleveland-Cliffs, as the assignee of the USW’s right to bid pursuant to the Right to Bid Assignment, had already submitted a bid, and invited Cleveland-Cliffs to enter into a nondisclosure agreement to permit Cleveland-Cliffs to receive confidential information regarding USS and the strategic alternatives review process.
Also on September 5, 2023, representatives from USS senior management, Barclays and Goldman Sachs met by videoconference with representatives from Company D and its financial advisors to discuss

the Company D financial model, projections, as well as potential transaction synergies as part of the assessment of the stock component of the Company D September 1 Proposal.
On September 6, 2023, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Milbank, Wachtell and Joele Frank participated. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs updated the Board of Directors on communications with Company D, including commencing diligence and reverse due diligence on the stock component of the Company D September 1 Proposal.
On September 8, 2023, Mr. Burritt and Mr. Holloway had a call with the Chief Executive Officer and the general counsel of Company D to provide an update that USS was working diligently to fully assess the Company D September 1 Proposal. Mr. Burritt also offered to formally invite Company D to participate in the strategic alternatives review process, subject to Company D’s execution of a customary confidentiality agreement. Mr. Burritt also sent a letter to the Chief Executive Officer of Company D memorializing the conversation.
On September 15, 2023, representatives from USS senior management, including Mr. Burritt, and representatives from Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Milbank, met via videoconference with representatives of Company D and its financial and legal advisors to discuss Company D’s strategic rationale for a transaction.
On September 18, 2023, Mr. Burritt had a telephone conference with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A, in which they discussed the upcoming deadline for preliminary indications of interest, and Mr. Burritt reiterated that the strategic alternatives review process would be competitive.
On September 19, 2023, Mr. Burritt had a telephone conference with the Chief Executive Officer of Company C, in which they discussed the upcoming deadline for preliminary indications of interest, and Mr. Burritt reiterated that the strategic alternatives review process would be competitive.
From September 20 to September 25, 2023, USS received eight additional non-binding indications of interest to acquire all or parts of USS. Consortium B, in partnership with another strategic party, submitted a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock for $31.00 per share in cash. Company A submitted a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock for $36.50 per share. On September 20, 2023, NSC submitted a proposal to acquire USS’s Mini Mill segment and its Keetac mining operations for an enterprise value of $9.2 billion and indicated a willingness to potentially submit a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock. Company C submitted a proposal to acquire USS’s Mini Mill segment, and its USS-UPI and Keetac mining operations for an enterprise value of approximately $8 billion and conveyed a willingness to potentially submit an updated proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock. Consortium B also submitted a proposal to acquire USS’s NAFR segment (excluding its Keetac mining operations) for an enterprise value of $3 billion. Three other parties also submitted proposals to acquire specific assets of USS: a proposal under which USS would spin off its Mini Mill segment and Keetac mining operations and merge them into a new public parent of the proposed bidder, at an implied enterprise value for the USS assets of $6.6 billion to $9.2 billion; a proposal to acquire USS’s Mini Mill segment for an enterprise value of $5 billion; and a proposal to acquire USS’s Keetac mining operations for a value of $600 million.
On September 22, 2023, representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, contacted representatives of NSC to confirm NSC’s intention regarding its willingness to potentially submit a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, and representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, encouraged the representatives of NSC to do so.
On September 27, 2023, Company C submitted an updated proposal to acquire the entirety of USS for $37.00 per share of USS common stock in cash, conditioned on finding partners to acquire all USS assets other than its Mini Mill segment, USS-UPI and Keetac mining operations. Also on September 27, 2023, NSC submitted an update to its earlier proposal to acquire USS’s Mini Mill segment and its Keetac mining operations for an enterprise value of $9.2 billion, which indicated a willingness to potentially submit a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, to specify that it estimated that a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock would be for an enterprise value of $9.5 billion.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Also on September 27, 2023, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Evercore, Milbank and Wachtell participated. Evercore was selected by USS as an additional financial advisor based on its reputation, experience and knowledge of the industrials industry and experience advising companies in mergers and acquisitions, and not by reason of any conflict of interest relating to Barclays or Goldman Sachs. Representatives from Wachtell provided a review of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties and other relevant legal matters in connection therewith. USS senior management reviewed again with the Board of Directors the September 2023 Projections, as further described in the section of this proxy statement titled “Certain Financial Projections.” Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs reviewed their respective preliminary financial analyses of USS based on the September 2023 Projections, then discussed the financial aspects of the preliminary proposals received to that date. Among other matters, the Board of Directors considered the possibility of pursuing transactions with multiple parties that submitted indications of interest with respect to specific assets. In considering the various transaction proposals that were received, the Board of Directors took into account the potential incremental execution risk, tax leakage and structuring complexities that would be presented by a structured transaction or an acquisition of limited assets relative to a whole company acquisition. Accordingly, participants in the strategic alternatives review process were encouraged to submit proposals for whole company acquisitions in addition to any structured proposals that they were considering. The Board of Directors also discussed the work undertaken by the Company and its financial and legal advisors to assess both the potential execution risk resulting from antitrust issues present in the proposed acquisition of USS by Company D, and the potential value of the stock component of the Company D September 1 Proposal (including the potential impact of divestitures that might be required to resolve antitrust concerns). At that meeting, after discussion, the Board of Directors directed Barclays, Goldman Sachs and USS senior management to seek to obtain a whole company acquisition proposal from NSC and to engage with other bidders to elicit revised, improved proposals. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, subsequently contacted representatives of NSC and suggested that NSC submit a revised proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock at a higher valuation than in NSC’s September 27, 2023 proposal.
On September 28, 2023, USS and Company D entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement that included a standstill provision expiring on December 1, 2023.
Also on September 28, 2023, USS entered into an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs pursuant to which it formally retained Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor in connection with the strategic alternatives review process.
On October 5, 2023, Company A submitted a revised proposal that contemplated the formation of a new publicly traded entity that would own USS and select assets of Company A. Such proposal stated that it implied a value of $40.50 per share of USS common stock. Under Company A’s proposal (which we refer to as the “Company A Structured Proposal”), USS stockholders would receive cash and approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of the newly formed entity and Company A would own the remaining 65% of the outstanding shares of the newly formed entity. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, informed the financial advisors for Company A that while USS would evaluate the Company A Structured Proposal, Company A should also submit a cash and/or stock proposal to improve its competitive positioning.
On October 5, 2023, following discussions between representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs and NSC’s financial advisor, based on feedback from the Board of Directors, NSC submitted a written, nonbinding indication of interest to acquire USS’s Mini Mill segment and its Keetac mining operations for an enterprise value of $9.2 billion or, in the alternative, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock for consideration of $41.40 per share in cash.
On October 9, 2023, five parties (Company A, Consortium B, Company C, Company D and NSC), received a letter inviting them to participate in the next phase of USS’s strategic alternatives review process, and indicating that parties could participate in management due diligence sessions and site visits during the upcoming weeks.
On October 10, 2023, Mr. Burritt and the Chief Executive Officer of Company A had a telephone conference to discuss the details of the Company A Structured Proposal, including matters related to potential transaction synergies and due diligence.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Beginning on October 20 through November 11, 2023, members of USS management met with representatives of the five parties that had been invited to participate in the next phase of USS’s strategic alternatives review process for management presentations, site visits and subject matter discussions. Members of USS management and representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs also responded to due diligence information requests from those parties through the end of November 2023.
From October 23, 2023 to October 24, 2023, the Board of Directors held a regularly scheduled inperson meeting of the Board of Directors in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Evercore, Milbank, and Wachtell present. The engagement of each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs was approved by the Board of Directors. Representatives from Wachtell provided a review of the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties and other relevant legal matters. Representatives from Milbank discussed their preliminary assessment of antitrust risk and considerations with respect to each participating party, including the extent to which a transaction with Company A or Company D presented material and substantial antitrust execution risk (including divestiture risk), while a transaction with NSC, Consortium B or Company C presented significantly less antitrust execution risk. In particular, representatives from Milbank noted that a transaction with either Company A or Company D would combine two of the top suppliers of certain steel products to the United States automobile industry. In addition, a transaction with Company D would eliminate the sole new competitor in non-grain-oriented steel production in North America as well as eliminate a competitive threat to Company D’s incumbent position in the United States, and put up to 95% of iron ore production in the United States under the control of a single company. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs then provided a general update on the strategic alternative review process and a preliminary review with respect to the financial aspects of the Company A Structured Proposal and the other proposals received. The Board of Directors was also informed that Covington & Burling LLP (which we refer to as “Covington”) had been retained by USS as outside CFIUS counsel and that Covington’s preliminary views were that although CFIUS filings would be merited for certain parties, including NSC, it did not anticipate that any of those transactions would implicate unresolvable national security concerns based on the identity of the counterparties.
On October 24, 2023, USS entered into an engagement letter with Barclays pursuant to which it formally retained Barclays as its financial advisor in connection with the strategic alternatives review process.
On October 30, 2023, Mr. Burritt and the Chief Executive Officer of Company A discussed via telephone matters related to safety, due diligence and the Company A Structured Proposal. Mr. Burritt and the Chief Executive Officer of Company A also agreed to schedule a meeting between the respective management teams of USS and Company A.
On October 31, 2023, the five parties that had been invited to participate in the next phase of USS’s strategic alternatives review process, received a process letter with instructions for the submission of revised proposals. The letter included a submission deadline of December 1, 2023, and notified bidders that a draft transaction agreement would be made available on November 10, 2023, with initial markups requested by November 20, 2023. In addition, at the direction of the Board of Directors, representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs communicated to representatives of Consortium B that USS might be willing to pair Consortium B with another bidder yet to be decided that is seeking to acquire the remainder of USS. Company C, among other bidders, was viewed by USS as a potential partner for Consortium B.
Also on October 31, 2023, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an association representing automobile manufacturers that produce vehicles sold in the United States, wrote a letter to members of Congress expressing its concern with the proposed acquisition by Cleveland-Cliffs of USS and urging them to “examine the potential for anti-competitive pricing of materials used by the steel-reliant automotive manufacturers” as a result of such a consolidation of steel production capacity, which would “further increase costs across the [automotive] industry for both materials and finished vehicles, slow EV adoption by driving up costs for customers, and put domestic automakers at a competitive disadvantage relative to manufacturers using steel from other parts of the world.” Specifically, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation stated that a transaction resulting in a combination of Cleveland-Cliffs and USS would result in combined control of (i) 100% of blast furnace production in the U.S., (ii) more than 90% of U.S. advance high strength steel used for automotive underbody panels, bodyside reinforcements and impact areas, (iii) 80% of body

in white steel used to produce a vehicle’s structural frame and (iv) 65% of U.S. exposed grade steel used for automotive surface panels like doors, hoods and fenders.
Also beginning on October 31, 2023 and continuing through the first two weeks of November 2023, representatives of various parties, including NSC, Company A, Consortium B, Company C and Company D, conducted visits to multiple USS operational sites. During this period, USS continued to hold diligence calls and management presentations with participating parties.
On November 10, 2023, representatives of Milbank and Wachtell sent representatives of NSC, Company A, Company C, Company D and Consortium B a draft merger agreement. The draft merger agreement included, among other things, a “hell or high water” antitrust efforts covenant, a fee (amount to be determined) payable to USS in the event of a termination of the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain regulatory approvals related to antitrust and CFIUS, and a requirement that the potential bidder assume USS’s obligations to the USW set forth in the Basic Labor Agreement. After discussions the following week with respect to potential transaction structures for Consortium B, on November 20, 2023, representatives of Milbank and Wachtell circulated a draft carve-out transaction agreement to legal counsel for Consortium B.
On November 20, 2023, NSC, Company A, Company C and Company D provided mark-ups of the draft merger agreements. NSC’s draft included no reverse termination fee and no “hell or high water” regulatory efforts covenants, but NSC did propose that it would agree to take certain specified actions if necessary to obtain antitrust approval. Company D’s draft included a commitment to take certain actions to address antitrust concerns, including divestitures of assets generating up to $2 billion of revenue, as well as a reverse termination fee of $500 million. On November 24, 2023, representatives of Milbank and Wachtell met via videoconference with legal counsel for each party to provide feedback on their mark-ups of the draft merger agreement. Discussions primarily focused on matters relating to closing certainty and timing, as well as, with respect to Company A and Company C, matters relating to the structure of the transactions proposed by such parties. During the strategic alternatives review process, NSC requested to meet with the USW to discuss its potential ownership of USS prior to entry into a definitive agreement. Milbank informed Ropes & Gray that such a meeting would be inappropriate in light of the need to maintain the confidentiality of the strategic alternatives review process, and in particular given that the USW was effectively a participant in the process due to the Right to Bid Assignment.
On November 21, 2023, members of USS management and representatives of its financial and legal advisors met with representatives of Company A and its financial and legal advisors to discuss potential transaction synergies in connection with the Company A Structured Proposal.
On November 25, 2023, Mr. Burritt met via videoconference with certain members of NSC’s senior management, including Takahiro Mori, Representative Director and Executive Vice President of NSC. The parties discussed perspectives on USS prior to final bid submissions. Also on November 25, 2023, representatives of Milbank sent representatives of Ropes & Gray LLP (which we refer to as “Ropes & Gray”), legal counsel to NSC, feedback on NSC’s mark-up of the draft merger agreement.
On November 26, 2023, legal counsel for Consortium B sent a revised draft of the carve-out transaction agreement to representatives of Milbank and Wachtell. On November 28, 2023, representatives of Milbank and Wachtell met via videoconference with legal counsel for Consortium B to provide feedback. Discussions primarily focused on structuring a potential carve-out transaction and matters relating to closing certainty and timing.
On December 1, 2023, Mr. Burritt and the Chief Executive Officer of Company A had a telephone call during which the Chief Executive Officer of Company A informed Mr. Burritt that Company A would not be submitting a whole-company proposal.
On December 1, 2023, USS received five revised indications of interest. NSC submitted a proposal to acquire USS for $43.00 per share of USS common stock in cash. Company D submitted a proposal to acquire USS for $25.00 per share of USS common stock in cash and 1.300 shares of Company D common stock per share of USS common stock, which proposal was valued at $48.74 per USS share based on the December 1, 2023 closing price of Company D common stock. Company A indicated that it was no longer interested in pursuing the Company A Structured Proposal, but instead submitted a bid for USS’s Mini Mill and Tubular

segments and Granite City Works and Keetac mining operations valued at $7.25 billion and sought to partner with Consortium B in connection with that proposed transaction. Consortium B submitted a proposal to acquire USS’s NAFR segment (other than its Keetac mining operations) and Tubular and USSE segments for $3.4 billion. Company C’s proposal to acquire the entirety of USS, which remained conditioned on finding partners to acquire all USS assets other than its Mini Mill segment, and USS-UPI and Keetac mining operations, was lower than its prior proposal submitted on September 20, 2023, which Company C attributed to newly identified costs and liabilities, including taxes, attributable to the structure of Company C’s proposal (the Company C proposal, together with the Company A and Consortium B proposal submitted on December 1 are referred to as the “December 1 Asset Sale Proposals”).
Also on December 1, 2023, NSC, Company C, Company D, and Consortium B provided revised draft transaction agreements together with their bids. NSC’s revised draft transaction agreement included a reverse termination fee equal to 2% of USS’s equity value, increased to 4% of USS’s equity value in the event of a willful breach of certain regulatory covenants by NSC, but no “hell or high water” regulatory efforts covenants, but NSC did propose that it would agree to take certain specified actions if necessary to obtain antitrust approval. Company D’s revised draft transaction agreement included a reverse termination fee of $1 billion, but no meaningful change from its November 20, 2023 draft in its commitment to actions necessary to obtain antitrust approval. Company A did not provide a draft agreement reflecting its new proposed structure.
On December 2, 2023, representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs notified NSC that its merger agreement markup was less competitive than others with respect to certain key deal terms, in particular regarding closing certainty, and that Milbank and Wachtell would circulate a revised draft merger agreement in the next few days.
On December 3, 2023, representatives of Milbank and Wachtell sent representatives of Ropes & Gray, a revised merger agreement that included enhanced certainty and key contract terms. In particular, the revised agreement included “hell or high water” antitrust and CFIUS efforts covenants, as well as a reverse termination fee equal to an unspecified percent of USS’s equity value.
On December 5, 2023, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Evercore, Milbank and Wachtell participated. Representatives from Wachtell discussed fiduciary duty considerations in connection with the strategic alternative review process and related legal matters. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs provided the Board of Directors with an update on the strategic alternatives review process and reviewed a comparison of proposals received on December 1, 2023. A representative of Milbank discussed the revised drafts of the transaction documents received with the December 1 proposals, as well as the further revised draft that was sent to NSC on December 3. The Board of Directors focused particularly on the provisions of the transaction documents affecting closing certainty and timing, as well as the provisions governing the Board of Directors’ ability to accept a competing offer should one arise following signing of an agreement with one party. The Board of Directors also discussed the fact that the Company D proposal would require a vote of Company D’s stockholders. With respect to the Company D proposal, the Board of Directors also discussed the potential impact resulting from divestitures that may be needed to obtain antitrust approvals on the value of Company D’s common stock. Representatives of Milbank advised the Board of Directors that, even if divestitures were offered that were aimed at addressing antitrust concerns, considerable risk remained that the U.S. Department of Justice would not accept those divestitures and would challenge the proposed acquisition of USS by Company D in court. Representatives of Milbank explained to the Board of Directors that this would be a challenging case for the parties to win in litigation. Representatives of Milbank also said that they were still working on an assessment of the size and scope of the divestiture package that would be needed for the parties to substantially improve their prospects of succeeding in such potential litigation. The Board of Directors was also informed that NSC had requested an in-person meeting with members of USS management and that Company D had an outstanding request to meet with members of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors discussed and approved an in-person meeting between members of USS management and NSC on December 8, 2023, and between members of the respective management teams of, and certain members of the respective board of directors of, both USS and Company D on December 9, 2023. Following discussion, the Board of Directors directed Barclays and Goldman Sachs to seek increased value, greater closing certainty and certain other provisions

from NSC and Company D. In light of the considerable antitrust risk associated with the proposed acquisition of USS by Company D and the potential material impact of any divestitures that might be required on the value of Company D’s common stock, and in order to eliminate the risk associated with the need of Company D to obtain the approval of its stockholders, the Board of Directors instructed Barclays and Goldman Sachs to seek an increase in the cash consideration, and a reduction in the quantum of Company D’s common stock included in its proposal. The Board of Directors also directed Barclays and Goldman Sachs to indicate to Company A, Company C and Consortium B that significant value increases would be required in order for their proposals to be competitive.
During the first two weeks of December 2023, members of USS management conducted site visits at certain of Company D’s facilities.
On December 8, 2023, members of USS management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Milbank met via videoconference with representatives of Company D and its financial and legal advisors to discuss potential transaction synergies.
On December 8, 2023, Mr. Burritt and other members of USS’s senior management met with Mr. Mori and other members of NSC’s senior management, in Chicago, Illinois. At that meeting, Mr. Mori stated that he would like to discuss with USS Mr. Burritt’s post-closing employment arrangements, but did not indicate what the terms of those post-closing employment arrangements would be. Mr. Burritt stated that, while he might consider remaining with USS post-closing if there were to be a transaction with NSC, such a discussion would be premature at that time. There was no further discussion of post-closing employment arrangements at the meeting or at any point prior to the signing of the Merger Agreement. Following the meeting, the representatives of the parties attended a dinner with a representative of Barclays and NSC’s financial advisor.
Also on December 8, Consortium B and Company A informed USS of their intention to submit a joint proposal to acquire all of USS.
On December 9, 2023, Mr. Burritt, Mr. Holloway, Mr. Sutherland, John Engel, Chair of the Corporate Governance & Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors, and Murry Gerber, Chair of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, met with representatives of Company D, including Company D’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and two independent members of the board of directors of Company D, for a meeting and lunch in Chicago, Illinois. Representatives from Wachtell and Barclays and Company D’s legal counsel and financial advisors were also present. The parties discussed, among other things, Company D’s perspective on potential antitrust challenges to a potential combination of USS and Company D, and how to respond to such challenges.
On December 11, 2023, representatives of Ropes & Gray sent representatives of Milbank and Wachtell a revised draft of the merger agreement. The revised draft included a “hell or high water” antitrust efforts covenant, as proposed by USS, as well as a reverse termination fee equal to an unspecified percent of USS’s equity value. With respect to efforts to obtain CFIUS clearance, the draft proposed limitations on NSC’s obligations to accept certain remedies to obtain CFIUS clearance.
On December 12, 2023, a draft of USS disclosure schedules was made available to NSC and Company D in the electronic dataroom. Also on December 12, 2023, USS allowed Consortium B and Company A to each amend its respective confidentiality agreement to allow for discussions with the other regarding a potential joint proposal.
On December 13, 2023, USS held a regularly scheduled in-person meeting of its Board of Directors at the USS headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Evercore, Milbank, and Wachtell participated. Representatives from Wachtell discussed fiduciary duty considerations in connection with the strategic alternative review process and related legal matters. Representatives from Barclays and Goldman Sachs discussed their respective preliminary financial analyses of USS and in the context of each of the NSC and Company D proposals submitted on December 1, 2023, as well as in connection with the December 1 Asset Sale Proposals. Such analyses utilized, in the case of Company D, USS management’s pro forma projections for the potential post-closing combined company, which included the impact of each of potential transaction synergies and divestitures that may be needed to obtain antitrust approvals. Representatives from Barclays and Goldman

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Sachs also discussed developments since the last meeting of the Board of Directors, including that on December 8, 2023, Consortium B and Company A had indicated an intention to submit a joint proposal to acquire all of USS, and Company C had indicated that it was unlikely to continue in the strategic alternatives review process given its limited ability to increase its proposal. A representative of Milbank discussed the revised draft of the merger agreement received from NSC, identifying areas where NSC had moved towards the USS position from its prior draft and some of the key issues remained open, including the termination fees that would be payable by USS and NSC under certain circumstances, the level of efforts required to obtain CFIUS clearance and the scope of interim operating covenants. Representatives of Milbank also discussed open points in the draft merger agreement received from Company D on December 1, 2023, including the level of commitment by Company D to obtain antitrust clearance and the termination fees that would be payable by USS and Company D in certain circumstances. Representatives of Milbank also reviewed antitrust considerations, including the relative antitrust risk associated with a transaction with NSC as compared to a transaction with Company D. In response to questions from the Board of Directors, representatives from Milbank discussed the reasons that they believed the potential antitrust risk inherent in a transaction with Company D was significantly greater than the level of antitrust risk conveyed by Company D to USS, including the likelihood of litigation (which could take up to 18 months or more from the date of signing to conclude), the significant divestitures that likely would be required to substantially improve the prospect of prevailing in such litigation, the likelihood that such divestitures would be in excess of the divestitures that Company D proposed to commit to in their draft merger agreement, the substantial risk that USS and Company D would not prevail in litigation regardless of any proposed divestitures, and the erosion of value to USS stockholders with respect to the stock component of Company D’s latest proposal as a result of any divestitures that might be required . In particular, representatives of Milbank stated their opinion, developed after numerous meetings with legal counsel to Company D and the parties’ respective economic experts, that to improve the prospects of prevailing in such litigation, the parties would have to agree to divest (and find appropriate counterparties who would agree to acquire), assets generating up to $7 billion or more in revenues of the combined company, which far exceeded the $2 billion commitment proposed by Company D in the draft merger agreement received from Company D on December 1, 2023. In addition, divestitures of individual facilities to third parties would present additional challenges under the successorship requirements of the Basic Labor Agreement.
Representatives from Milbank and Wachtell also discussed other factors potentially affecting certainty and timing of closing for potential transactions with each party, including that each of NSC and Company D had obtained financing commitments on customary terms, the fact that a transaction with NSC would require CFIUS clearance and the fact that a transaction with Company D would require approval of Company D’s stockholders in connection with the issuance of Company D common stock. In addition, the Board of Directors discussed the views of the USW and the rights of the USW under the Basic Labor Agreement in connection with the process (including the Right to Bid Assignment) and USS’s compliance therewith. At that meeting, following discussion, and after taking into consideration the information provided by and discussed with USS senior management and its advisors, the Board of Directors directed USS senior management, Barclays and Goldman Sachs to continue seeking increased value and reduced conditionality from NSC and Company D, including by seeking to increase the cash consideration component of Company D’s proposal so that a vote of Company D’s stockholders would not be required, and so as to lessen the potential impact of divestitures on deal consideration in connection with a Company D transaction.
Also on December 13, 2023, representatives of Ropes & Gray sent representatives of Milbank and Wachtell a revised draft of the USS disclosure schedules. Representatives of Ropes & Gray, Milbank and Wachtell continued to negotiate the USS disclosure schedules until December 18, 2023 when the Merger Agreement was signed.
That same day, representatives of Company A and Consortium B submitted a joint proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock for $40 per share in cash (which we refer to as the “$40 Joint Bid”). Representatives of Company A and Consortium B were notified by representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, as directed by the Board of Directors, that their proposal was not competitive.
Also on December 13, 2023, representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, conveyed to NSC and its financial advisor that the strategic alternatives review process remained competitive and requested that NSC undertake to improve the total value and closing certainty of its proposal. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs also conveyed that representatives of Milbank

and Wachtell would provide a revised draft of the merger agreement and requested that NSC provide a revised proposal no later than December 15, 2023.
On December 14, 2023, representatives of Milbank and Wachtell sent a revised draft merger agreement to legal counsel for Company D, and representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, conveyed to Company D the request that Company D undertake to increase the total value and cash consideration portion of its proposal and increase the size of the reverse termination fee. That same day, representatives of Milbank and Wachtell sent representatives of Ropes & Gray a revised draft of the merger agreement.
On December 15, 2023, representatives of Ropes & Gray sent representatives of Milbank and Wachtell a revised draft of the merger agreement. That same day, NSC submitted a non-binding offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock for $48.00 in cash per share. The revised draft of the merger agreement included a reverse termination fee equal to 4% of USS’s equity value, but maintained the same proposal regarding antitrust and CFIUS efforts contained in the draft that representatives of Ropes & Gray sent to representatives of Milbank and Wachtell on December 11, 2023. Later that same day, Company D submitted to USS a non-binding offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock for $27.00 in cash and 1.444 shares of Company D stock per share of USS common stock, representing a value of $54.00 per share of USS common stock based on the closing price of Company D common stock on December 15, 2023 (which we refer to as the “Company D Final Proposal”). The Company D Final Proposal also indicated its estimate of $6.50 per share of USS common stock in potential synergy value for USS stockholders. The Company D Final Proposal did not meaningfully change the mix of stock and cash consideration; as a result, approval of Company D stockholders would still be required in order to consummate the Company D Final Proposal. In the Company D Final Proposal, Company D stated that the proposed consideration represented its “final proposal” and requested feedback following the conclusion of the discussions among the Board of Directors, which Company D understood were to occur on December 16 or December 17, 2023. The Company D Final Proposal also stated that lack of feedback in a timely fashion would be considered rejection of the Company D Final Proposal. Company D also submitted a revised draft of the merger agreement, which did not include an improved commitment with respect to antitrust efforts, but did include an increase in their proposed reverse termination fee from $1 billion on December 1, 2023 to $1.5 billion. Also on December 15, 2023, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Company D and representatives of Company D’s financial advisor contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss timing for USS’s response to the Company D Final Proposal and, during such conversation, reiterated that such proposal was “final.”
In the morning on December 16, 2023, representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, at the direction of the Board of Directors, spoke with representatives of NSC and its financial advisor and conveyed that the strategic alternative review process remained competitive and requested that NSC submit its final proposal. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Mori indicated to Mr. Burritt that, subject to final NSC board approval, NSC proposed to acquire USS for $55.00 per share in cash (which we refer to as the “NSC December 16 Proposal”).
In the afternoon of December 16, 2023, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Evercore, Milbank, Wachtell and Joele Frank participated. Representatives from Wachtell discussed fiduciary duty considerations and other relevant legal matters in the context of the consideration of a proposal to acquire USS. Representatives of Barclays and Goldman Sachs reviewed their respective preliminary financial analyses of USS in the context of the NSC December 16 Proposal and the Company D Final Proposal. Representatives from Barclays and Goldman Sachs also discussed developments since the last meeting of the Board of Directors, including receipt of the $40 Joint Bid. Representatives of Milbank discussed the December 15, 2023 merger agreement drafts received from each of NSC and Company D, including the potential impact on the timing and certainty of the closing of a transaction as well as the provisions restricting USS and its representatives from soliciting competing offers and governing the directors’ ability to consider unsolicited competing offers for USS. With respect to Company D, representatives of Milbank noted that, although Company D had accepted USS’s proposed $1.5 billion termination fee payable by Company D if antitrust approvals were not obtained, Company D had not improved its antitrust efforts commitments under the merger agreement. Accordingly, there remained a substantial risk that the potential

TABLE OF CONTENTS
divestitures that might be required to close a transaction with Company D would be in excess of the commitment with respect to required divestitures that Company D was willing to undertake, thereby reducing closing certainty. The Board of Directors also considered potential transaction synergies relative to the potential value loss to USS stockholders resulting from potential required regulatory divestitures under different scenarios. Representatives of Milbank also noted that approval of Company D’s stockholders would be required in order to the consummate the potential transaction. With respect to NSC, representatives of Milbank noted that although NSC had accepted USS’s proposed termination fee payable by NSC if regulatory approvals were not obtained (4% of transaction value or approximately $565 million), NSC had not improved its commitments under the merger agreement to seek CFIUS clearance. Representatives for Milbank and Wachtell relayed recent discussions between representatives of Covington and Ropes & Gray, including Covington’s assessment of the likelihood of obtaining CFIUS clearance as long as NSC made the necessary commitments with respect thereto. In addition, the Board of Directors again discussed the views of the USW and the rights of the USW under the Basic Labor Agreement in connection with the process and USS’s compliance therewith. At that meeting, following discussion, and after taking into consideration the information provided by and discussed with USS management and advisors, the Board of Directors directed Milbank and Wachtell, together with Covington, to seek to improve NSC’s commitment to seek CFIUS clearance and to obtain more information with respect to NSC’s operations, and to seek to close out any remaining open issues in the merger agreement prior to the special meeting of the Board of Directors scheduled for the next day. In addition, the Board of Directors instructed representatives of Milbank and Wachtell to continue negotiating the remaining open issues in Company D’s draft merger agreement with Company D’s legal counsel, including with respect to the antitrust efforts required to be undertaken by Company D to obtain regulatory approvals.
In the evening of December 16, 2023, Mr. Burritt had a brief call with Mr. Mori to convey the need for more certainty with respect to NSC’s commitment to seek CFIUS clearance.
On December 16 and 17, 2023, representatives of Milbank and Wachtell continued to negotiate merger agreements with representatives of Ropes & Gray and legal counsel for Company D. During such discussions, legal counsel for Company D confirmed that its proposal with respect to antitrust regulatory efforts and the commitment to divestitures included in its draft merger agreement dated December 15, 2023 was “final.” NSC’s commitment to obtaining CFIUS clearance under the merger agreement continued to be the primary open issue until the afternoon of December 17, 2023, when representatives of Ropes & Gray indicated that NSC would agree to take all actions required to obtain CFIUS clearance, so long as such actions (solely with respect to NSC’s assets) would not reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on NSC, assuming for such purposes that NSC were the size of, and with the financial profile of, NSC and USS, taken as a whole.
Shortly after this discussion, USS held a special meeting of its Board of Directors virtually, during which members of USS senior management and representatives of Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Evercore, Milbank, Wachtell, Covington and Joele Frank participated. Representatives from Wachtell and Milbank discussed fiduciary duty considerations in the context of the consideration of a proposal by NSC to acquire USS and related legal matters. A representative of Milbank reviewed again the key terms of the transaction proposed by NSC, including provisions relating to efforts required to be undertaken to obtain regulatory approvals, the termination fee payable by NSC if regulatory approvals were not obtained, and the potential impact on the timing of the closing of a transaction as well as the provisions restricting USS and its representatives from soliciting competing offers and governing the directors’ ability to consider unsolicited competing offers for USS. Representatives of Covington, Milbank and Wachtell addressed questions from the directors, including regarding the current regulatory environment and required regulatory approvals. The Board of Directors again discussed the views of the USW and the rights of the USW under the Basic Labor Agreement in connection with the process and USS’s compliance therewith. At that meeting, the Board of Directors also formally approved the engagement of Evercore as a financial advisor to USS in connection with the strategic alternatives review process.
Representatives of each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs respectively presented each of Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective financial analysis of the proposed transaction relative to the December 2023 Projections (as further described in the section of this proxy statement titled “Certain Financial Projections”). Following such discussion, representatives of Barclays rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion,

confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 18, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Barclays’ written opinion, the merger consideration of $55.00 per share to be offered to the holders of USS common stock in the Merger was fair to such holders from a financial point of view. Also, following such discussion, representatives of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Board of Directors its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 18, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the merger consideration of $55.00 per share to be paid to the holders (other than NSC and its affiliates) of USS common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
At that meeting, following discussion, and after taking into consideration the information provided by and discussed with USS management and advisors, including the factors described below in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement titled “Reasons for the Merger,” the Board of Directors unanimously (1) determined that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of USS and its stockholders, (2) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, subject to approval by NSC’s board of directors of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (3) resolved to recommend that USS stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and (4) directed that the adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted for consideration by USS stockholders at the Special Meeting. The Board of Directors further unanimously determined that the NSC proposal was superior to the other proposals received because it was more favorable to USS and its stockholders, taking into consideration such factors as price, form of consideration, certainty of payment, conditions precedent to closing, regulatory and competitive factors and other factors influencing which of the proposals was in the best interests of USS and its stockholders.
Following the meeting of the Board of Directors on December 17, 2023, representatives of Milbank, Wachtell and Ropes & Gray finalized the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents. During this time, late in the evening of December 17, 2023, Company D delivered a letter to USS by email stating that the Company D Final Proposal continued to be its final proposal and stating that the proposal remained outstanding past December 17, given the progress that had been made between the legal counsel for USS and Company D on Company D’s draft merger agreement. In the evening of December 17, 2023, Mr. Burritt had a brief discussion with Mr. Mori regarding the Board of Directors’ approval of the NSC proposal. Later that evening, representatives of NSC informed representatives of USS that NSC’s board of directors had approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
The Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents between NSC and USS were executed early on December 18, 2023. Before the opening of market on December 18, 2023, USS and NSC issued a press release announcing the transaction and held a joint investor call.
Later that day, representatives of Ropes & Gray and Littler Mendelson P.C., outside labor counsel to NSC, met with representatives of the USW to discuss, among other things, the successorship provisions provided in Article Two, Section D.3 of the BLA (which we refer to as the “Successorship Clause”). Thereafter, representatives of Ropes & Gray sent to representatives of the USW a letter from Parent in satisfaction of the Successorship Clause.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the Compensation Proposal; and (3) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.
Reasons for the Merger
In evaluating the Merger, the Board of Directors consulted with USS’s senior management and its independent legal and financial advisors and considered a number of factors that the Board of Directors viewed as supporting its decision, including the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
•	Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value Following a Thorough and Well-Publicized Process. The Board of Directors considered that the value of the Merger Consideration of $55.00 in cash per share of USS common stock was more favorable to USS’s stockholders than the potential value that might result from other alternatives reasonably available to USS, including the continued operation of USS on a standalone basis, in light of a number of factors, including the following:
•	the Board of Directors’ assessment of USS’s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and historical and projected financial performance (taking into account USS’s potential for, and risks to, future growth), the nature of the industries in which USS operates, including recent competitive and market trends and dynamics;
•	that USS had conducted a lengthy and thorough process since the public announcement of the strategic alternatives review process on August 13, 2023, involving outreach to potential strategic acquirers and financial sponsors, of which 19 entered into nondisclosure agreements with USS and received access to due diligence materials, nine provided first round indications of interest to acquire all or parts of USS, and five provided final proposals to acquire all or parts of USS;
•	that NSC stated that its $55.00 per share in cash proposal represented the maximum price that NSC could offer, following NSC’s prior proposals offering $48.00 per share and $43.00 per share, and a significant increase over NSC’s original offer to acquire USS at $41.40 per share;
•	the high degree of certainty of closing in light of, among other things, the absence of significant competitive overlaps between USS and NSC, NSC’s strong commitment to obtain the required regulatory approvals, the delivery and enforceability of the Commitment Letters and the absence of a requirement for approval by NSC’s stockholders;
•	the course and history of USS’s discussions and negotiations with NSC and the other bidders, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Background of the Merger,” including the multiple rounds of bids submitted by other parties and the expectation that each other bidder had put forward the best terms that they were willing to offer for a strategic transaction (including, in the case of Company D, express statements that their most recent submission constituted their final offer);
•	that USS and its financial advisors responded to third parties who expressed interest in a possible transaction on an unsolicited basis and who they believed were reasonably capable of consummating a transaction by offering such third parties the opportunity to conduct due diligence and make a proposal, including proposals contemplating various transaction structures and transaction scopes; and
•	that the Board of Directors had conducted extensive deliberations over a period of four months since the announcement of the strategic alternatives review process, to oversee and provide direction to the process, and extensive deliberations over a period of five total months since Company A’s first offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, to evaluate alternatives for USS.
•	Premium. The Board of Directors considered the current and historical market prices of USS common stock, including the market performance of USS common stock relative to those of other publicly traded companies in USS’s sector and general market indices, and the fact that the Merger Consideration of $55.00 per share in cash represented a substantial premium to estimates of USS’s unaffected stock price, including a premium of approximately 142% to USS’s unaffected stock price of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
$22.72 on August 11, 2023, the day prior to USS’s announcement of the strategic alternatives review process and a premium of approximately 40% to USS’s closing stock price of $39.33 on December 15, 2023, the last trading day before public announcement of the Merger Agreement.
•	Certainty of Value. The Board of Directors considered that the proposed Merger Consideration is a fixed cash amount, providing USS stockholders with a certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon the closing of the Merger, in comparison to the risks, uncertainties and potentially longer timeline for realizing equivalent value from USS’s standalone business plan or possible strategic alternatives, including with respect to the speculative, contingent value inherent in the stock component of Company D’s final proposal. In considering the Merger Consideration and comparing it against potential alternatives for USS, the Board of Directors took into account the potential incremental execution risk, tax leakage and structuring complexities that would be presented by a structured transaction or an acquisition of limited assets relative to a whole company acquisition and leveraged its knowledge of the business, assets, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of USS, as well as its knowledge of the current and prospective environment in which USS operates, including uncertain economic, market and capital raising conditions.
•	Negotiation Process. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the terms of the Merger Agreement were informed by the advice and professional experience of USS’s independent financial and legal advisors and were the result of robust negotiations.
•	Opinions of USS’s Financial Advisors.
•	The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis presented by Barclays and the oral opinion rendered to the Board of Directors, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 18, 2023, that, as of such date and subject to the assumptions and limitations made therein, the Merger Consideration to be offered to the holders of USS common stock in the Merger was fair to such holders from a financial point of view, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” The full text of the written opinion of Barclays is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
•	The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis presented by Goldman Sachs and the oral opinion rendered to the Board of Directors, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 18, 2023, that, as of such date and subject to the assumptions and limitations made therein, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than NSC and its affiliates) of USS common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as further described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.” The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.
•	Terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
•	the provisions allowing the Board of Directors, subject to certain conditions, to provide information in response to, and to discuss and negotiate, certain unsolicited alternative proposals made prior to the receipt of the required approval by the USS stockholders of the Merger;
•	the provisions allowing the Board of Directors to, prior to obtaining the required approval by the USS stockholders of the Merger, change its recommendation with respect to the Merger in specified circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, subject to Parent’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment by USS of the termination fee of $565 million;
•	the provision allowing the Board of Directors to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal, subject to certain conditions (including certain rights of Parent to match the Superior Proposal and the payment to Parent of the termination fee of $565 million);
•	the fact that the Merger Agreement permits USS to continue to pay to USS stockholders regular quarterly dividends in an amount not to exceed a quarterly rate of $0.05 in cash per share;

•	the provisions of the Merger Agreement providing that Parent would take all necessary action to assume all applicable agreements with the USW with respect to USS, and other assurances of Parent relative to such agreements; and
•	the availability of statutory appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the Merger.
•	Opportunity for USS Stockholders to Vote. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger would be subject to the approval of USS stockholders, and USS stockholders would be free to evaluate the Merger and vote for or against the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting.
•	Timing of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Merger and concluded that the Merger could be completed in a reasonable timeframe and in an orderly manner. The Board of Directors also considered that the potential for closing the Merger in a reasonable timeframe could reduce the period during which USS’s business would be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.
•	Likelihood of Completion. The Board of Directors considered the absence of a financing condition or similar contingency based on Parent’s ability to obtain financing, Parent’s committed financing, the strong commitment made by Parent to obtain regulatory approvals and the fact that Parent’s and Merger Sub’s payment and performance obligations under the Merger Agreement are guaranteed by NSC.
•	Operating Flexibility. The Board of Directors considered the fact that the Merger Agreement provides USS sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course until the earlier of the consummation of the Merger and the termination of the Merger Agreement, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Conduct of Business Pending the Merger.”
•	Labor Matters. The Board of Directors considered Parent’s commitment to honor all existing agreements between USS and the USW, including the Basic Labor Agreement, and Parent’s recognition of the USW as the bargaining representative for employees of USS who are represented by the USW, in each case, as provided under the Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors also considered the fact that NSC has the financial wherewithal to honor all existing agreements with the USW.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•	Specific Performance. The Board of Directors considered USS’s ability, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, to seek specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to cause the Merger to occur and to prevent other breaches of the Merger Agreement.
•	Guaranty. The Board of Directors considered the guaranty of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations under the Merger Agreement by NSC pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which provides substantial assurance that Parent and Merger Sub would perform their obligations under the Merger Agreement.
In the course of their deliberations, the Board of Directors also considered certain risks and other potentially adverse factors concerning the Merger, including:
•	the fact that completion of the transaction depends on certain factors outside of USS’s and Parent’s control, including regulatory approvals and USS stockholder approval, and that there can be no assurance that the conditions to the transaction will be satisfied even if the Merger is approved by USS stockholders;
•	the fact that the nature of the Merger as an all-cash transaction means that USS would no longer exist as an independent public company following the consummation of the Merger and that USS stockholders will not participate in future earnings or growth of the Surviving Corporation or benefit from any appreciation in value of the Surviving Corporation;
•	the provisions of the Merger Agreement that restrict USS’s ability to solicit or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal, subject to certain exceptions, and that restrict USS from entering into an alternative acquisition agreement, including the covenants in the Merger Agreement requiring USS to provide Parent with an opportunity within five business days to match any Alternative Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, which could discourage potential acquirors from making a competing Alternative Proposal, although the Board of Directors believed these covenants would not preclude an interested and able potential acquiror from seeking to acquire USS;
•	the possibility that USS could be required under the terms of the Merger Agreement to pay to Parent a termination fee of $565 million under certain circumstances;
•	the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger and the substantial time and effort of management required to consummate the Merger and related disruptions to the operation of our business;
•	the potential consequences of non-consummation of the transaction, including the potential negative impacts on USS, its business and the trading price of its shares of common stock;
•	the fact that the USW had expressed its support for an alternative transaction, and the possibility that the USW would seek to challenge a transaction with NSC;
•	the fact that USS’s remedies in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances may be limited to the Parent Termination Fee of $565 million, payable by Parent under certain circumstances, and certain associated enforcement costs and certain other reimbursement obligations, which may be inadequate to compensate USS for any damage caused, and that such termination fee may not be available in all instances where the Merger is not consummated and, even if available, such rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain;
•	the Merger Agreement’s restrictions on the conduct of USS’s business before completion of the Merger, generally requiring USS to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and prohibiting USS from taking certain customary specified actions, which could delay or prevent USS from pursuing certain business opportunities that arise pending completion of the Merger;
•	the fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the failure to complete the Merger, or actions that USS may be required, or Parent may be permitted, to take under the Merger Agreement could have an adverse impact on our existing and

prospective business relationships with customers and other third parties and on our employees, including the risk that certain key members of USS’s management might choose not to remain employed with USS prior to the completion of the Merger, regardless of whether or not the Merger is completed;
•	that the exchange of USS common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction to USS’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•	that some of USS’s directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of USS stockholders generally, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Interests of USS’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger”; and
•	other risks described in and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, see “Risk Factors” in USS’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, incorporated by reference herein and the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
The Board of Directors concluded that the uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors relevant to the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger.
The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material positive and negative factors considered by the Board of Directors. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, and the complexity of these matters, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether, or to what extent, any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination. The Board of Directors based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including the factors described above. The explanation of the factors and reasoning set forth above is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light of the factors set forth in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.
USS engaged Barclays to act as a financial advisor with respect to pursuing strategic alternatives for USS, including a possible sale of USS, pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 24, 2023. At a special meeting of the Board of Directors held to evaluate the Merger, Barclays rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion dated December 18, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Barclays’ written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be offered to the holders of USS common stock in the Merger was fair to such holders from a financial point of view.
The full text of Barclays’ written opinion to the Board of Directors is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. Barclays’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays’ opinion and the methodology that Barclays used to render its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
Barclays’ opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays’ Fairness Opinion Committee, is addressed to the Board of Directors, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be offered to the holders of USS common stock and does not constitute a recommendation to any USS stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. The terms of the Merger were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between USS and NSC and were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to USS or that any specific form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. Barclays was not requested to address, and its opinion does not in any manner address, USS’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the Merger, the likelihood

of the consummation of the Merger, or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which USS may engage. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to the holders of USS common stock in the Merger or otherwise. No limitations were imposed by the Board of Directors upon Barclays with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:
•	reviewed and analyzed the Merger Agreement and the specific terms of the Merger;
•	reviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning USS that Barclays believed to be relevant to its analysis, including USS’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023;
•	reviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of USS furnished to Barclays by USS, including financial projections of USS prepared by the management of USS and approved for Barclays’ use by USS (referred to in this section of this proxy statement as the “December 2023 Projections” and which are summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 64);
•	reviewed and analyzed a trading history of USS common stock from December 15, 2021 to December 15, 2023 and a comparison of that trading history with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
•	reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of USS with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
•	reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the financial terms of the Merger with the financial terms of certain other recent transactions that Barclays deemed relevant;
•	reviewed and analyzed published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance and price targets of USS;
•	reviewed and analyzed the results of Barclays’ efforts to solicit indications of interest from third parties with respect to a sale of all or a part of USS;
•	had discussions with the management of USS concerning its business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects; and
•	had undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by Barclays without any independent verification of such information (and did not assume responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information). Barclays also relied upon the assurances of the management of USS that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the December 2023 Projections, upon the advice of USS, Barclays assumed that such projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of USS as to the future financial performance of USS. Barclays assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of USS and did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of USS. Barclays’ opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, December 18, 2023. Barclays assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on events or circumstances that may have occurred after December 18, 2023.
Barclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and all agreements related thereto. Barclays also assumed, upon the advice of USS, that all material governmental, regulatory and third-party approvals, consents and releases for the Merger will be

obtained within the constraints contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. Barclays did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the Merger, nor did Barclays opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Barclays understood USS had obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.
In connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as summarized below. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values to the shares of USS common stock, but rather made its determination as to fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be offered to the holders of USS common stock in the Merger on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses.
In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by it but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses performed and factors considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.
Summary of Material Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to the Board of Directors. The summary of Barclays’ analyses and reviews provided below is not a complete description of the analyses and reviews underlying Barclays’ opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and review and the application of those methods to particular circumstances, and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary description.
For the purposes of its analyses and reviews, Barclays made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of USS or any other parties to the Merger. No company, business or transaction considered in Barclays’ analyses and reviews is identical to USS or the Merger and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions considered in Barclays’ analyses and reviews. None of USS, Barclays or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the companies, businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Barclays’ analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.
The summary of the financial analyses and reviews provided below includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses and reviews used by Barclays, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses and reviews, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Barclays’ analyses and reviews.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
In order to estimate the present value of USS common stock, Barclays performed a discounted cash flow analysis of USS. A discounted cash flow analysis is a traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of the asset. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.
To calculate the estimated enterprise value of USS using the discounted cash flow method, Barclays added (i) USS’s projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows for the period from October 1, 2023 to December 31, 2033 based on the December 2023 Projections to (ii) the “terminal value” of USS as of December 31, 2033, and then discounted such amount to its present value using a mid-year convention and a range of selected discount rates. The residual value of USS at the end of the forecast period, or “terminal value,” was estimated by selecting a range of perpetuity growth rates ranging from (1.0)% to 1.0%, which were derived by Barclays utilizing its professional judgment and experience. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value as of September 30, 2023 using discount rates of 11.5% to 13.5%. The range of discount rates was selected based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of USS. Barclays then calculated a range of implied equity values per share of USS common stock by subtracting estimated net debt and non-controlling interest, in each case as of September 30, 2023, from the estimated enterprise values using the discounted cash flow method and dividing such amounts by the fully diluted number of shares of USS common stock outstanding as of December 14, 2023, based on information provided by management of USS and approved for Barclays’ use by USS. The following summarizes the result of these calculations (rounded to the nearest $1.00):
Discount Rates
Perpetuity Growth Rates
Implied Equity Value per Share of USS Common Stock
11.5%- 13.5%
(1.0)% - 1.0%
$39-$50
Barclays noted that on the basis of the discounted cash flow analysis, the Merger Consideration was above the range of the implied equity values per share of USS common stock calculated using the December 2023 Projections.
Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Barclays performed an analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of USS common stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of the theoretical future value of a company’s equity as a function of such company’s financial projections and valuation multiples.
Barclays first calculated the implied future enterprise values of USS for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 through December 31, 2027 by applying ratios of USS’s enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which is referred to in this section as “EBITDA”) for the next 12-month (which is referred to in this section as “NTM”) period (which is referred to in this section as “EV/NTM EBITDA”) ranging from 4.5x to 6.0x to NTM EBITDA estimates for USS as reflected in the December 2023 Projections for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 through December 31, 2027. The illustrative EV/NTM EBITDA multiple estimates were derived by Barclays utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical trading data for USS as of December 15, 2023.
Barclays then calculated a range of implied equity values per share of USS common stock by (i) subtracting the projected amount of USS’s net debt and non-controlling interest as of each respective fiscal year end based on the December 2023 Projections, (ii) dividing such amount by the estimated fully diluted number of shares of USS common stock outstanding as of each respective fiscal year end, based on information provided by management of USS and approved for Barclays’ use by USS and (iii) adding to such implied future equity values per share of USS common stock the projected amount of cumulative dividends per share of USS common stock, as applicable, based on the December 2023 Projections.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Utilizing a discount rate of 15.0% based on an analysis of the cost of equity of USS, Barclays then derived a range of implied present values per share of USS common stock by discounting to present value as of September 30, 2023, the implied future values per share of USS common stock. The following summarizes the result of these calculations (rounded to the nearest $1.00):
EV/NTM	Implied Equity Value per Share of
EBITDA Multiple Range	USS Common Stock
4.5x - 6.0x	$38-$47
Barclays noted that, on the basis of the present value of the illustrative future share price analysis, the Merger Consideration was above the range of the implied equity values per share of USS common stock calculated using the December 2023 Projections.
Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis
Barclays reviewed and compared the purchase prices and implied valuation metrics in selected precedent transactions that Barclays, based on its experience with merger and acquisition transactions, deemed relevant. Barclays chose such transactions based on, among other things, the similarity of the applicable target companies in the transactions to USS with respect to certain operations or financial characteristics that Barclays deemed relevant. The selected precedent transactions were:
Year Announced	Production Method	Acquiror	Target
2014	Electric Arc Furnace (“EAF”)	Steel Dynamics, Inc. (“Steel Dynamics”)	Severstal Columbus, LLC (“Columbus”)
2014	Integrated	AK Steel Corporation (“AKS”)	Severstal Dearborn, LLC (“Dearborn”)
2014	EAF	Nucor Corporation (“Nucor”)	Gallatin Steel Company (“Gallatin”)
2015	EAF	BlueScope Steel Limited	North Star BlueScope Steel LLC (“North Star”)
2019	Integrated	Cleveland-Cliffs	AKS
2020	Integrated	Cleveland-Cliffs	ArcelorMittal USA LLC (“ArcelorMittal USA”)
2020	EAF	USS	Big River Steel Holdings LLC
(“BRS”)
Using publicly available information, Barclays analyzed the ratio of (i) each of Columbus’, Dearborn’s, Gallatin’s, North Star’s and AKS’ respective enterprise value to EBITDA for the last 12-month (which is referred to in this section as “LTM”) period (which is referred to in this section as “EV/LTM EBITDA”) at the time of announcement of each respective transaction, (ii) ArcelorMittal USA’s enterprise value to average EBITDA for the period from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2020 and (iii) BRS’ enterprise value to run-rate EBITDA at the time of announcement of the transaction. The following summarizes the result of these calculations:
Multiple
Total Average	6.9x
Total Median	6.4x
EAF Average	6.6x
EAF Median	6.5x
Integrated Average	7.3x
Integrated Median	6.0x

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were diverse and there are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of USS and the companies included in the selected precedent transaction analysis. Accordingly, Barclays believed that a purely quantitative selected precedent transaction analysis would not be particularly meaningful in the context of considering the Merger. Barclays, therefore, made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of the selected precedent transactions and the Merger which would affect the acquisition values of the selected target companies and USS. Based upon these judgments, Barclays selected a range of EV/LTM EBITDA multiples of 6.0x to 7.0x and applied such range to an estimate of the LTM EBITDA of USS as of September 30, 2023, based on the December 2023 Projections, to derive a range of estimated enterprise values of USS. Barclays then calculated a range of implied equity values per share of USS common stock by (i) subtracting the amount of USS’s estimated net debt and non-controlling interest from the respective range of estimated enterprise values, in each case as of September 30, 2023 based on the December 2023 Projections and (ii) dividing such amounts by the estimated fully diluted number of shares of USS common stock, based on information provided by management of USS and approved for Barclays’ use by USS. The following summarizes the result of these calculations (rounded to the nearest $1.00):
EV/LTM	Implied Equity Value per Share of
EBITDA Multiple Range	USS Common Stock
6.0x - 7.0x	$50-$58
Barclays noted that on the basis of the selected precedent transactions analysis, the Merger Consideration was within the range of the implied equity values per share of USS common stock calculated using the December 2023 Projections.
Other Factors
Barclays also reviewed and considered other factors, which were not considered part of its financial analyses in connection with rendering its advice, but were references for informational purposes, including, among other things, the historical share price analysis and equity research price targets analysis described below.
Historical Share Price Analysis
To illustrate the trend in the historical trading prices of USS common stock, Barclays considered historical data with regard to the trading prices of USS common stock for the period from August 11, 2022 to August 11, 2023. Barclays noted that during the period from August 11, 2022 to August 11, 2023, the intra-day price of USS common stock (rounded to the nearest $1.00) ranged from $18 to $32. The historical share price analysis was used for informational purposes only and was not included in Barclays’ financial analyses.
Equity Research Price Targets Analysis
Barclays reviewed and compared publicly available research analysts’ per share price targets as of August 11, 2023 for USS common stock. The research analysts’ per share price targets for USS common stock (rounded to the nearest $1.00) ranged from $14 to $30. The publicly available per share price targets published by securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect the current market trading prices for USS common stock and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including future financial performance of USS and future market conditions. Research analyst price targets for USS were used for informational purposes only and were not included in Barclays’ financial analyses.

familiarity with USS and its qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions generally, as well as substantial experience in transactions comparable to the Merger.
Barclays is acting as a financial advisor to USS in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between USS and Barclays provides for aggregate fees of approximately $68 million in connection with the Merger, including a transaction fee of approximately $63 million upon the completion of the Merger, approximately $13 million of which was payable upon the announcement of the Merger. A $5 million fee was paid upon execution of the engagement letter between USS and Barclays for prior work performed in connection with the Merger. The engagement letter between USS and Barclays also contemplated an independence fee of $22.5 million that would have been payable solely in the event that USS did not enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction by a certain date. In addition, USS has agreed to reimburse Barclays for a portion of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and to indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement by USS and the rendering of Barclays’ opinion. Barclays has performed various investment banking services for USS in the past, and expects to perform such services in the future, and has received, and expects to receive, customary fees for such services. During the two years prior to December 18, 2023, Barclays has provided various investment banking and financial services to USS for which Barclays has received compensation in an amount of approximately $2.6 million, excluding any compensation received in connection with the Merger. Specifically, in the past two years, Barclays has performed the following investment banking and financial services for USS: (i) in August 2022, acted as a co-manager on USS’s offering of $290 million of municipal bonds, (ii) in May 2023, acted as a co-manager on USS’s offering of $240 million of municipal bonds, (iii) acted as financial advisor to USS in connection with certain potential divestiture transactions and (iv) participated as a lender under USS’s existing credit facilities. In the past two years, Barclays has not received investment banking fees from NSC or any of its subsidiaries.
Barclays and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial banking, lending, asset management and other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of its business, Barclays and its affiliates may actively trade and effect transactions in the equity, debt and/or other securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments (including loans and other obligations) of USS, Parent and NSC for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions and investments in such securities and financial instruments.
Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
At a special meeting of the Board of Directors held to evaluate the Merger, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of a written opinion dated December 18, 2023, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions described in Goldman Sachs’ written opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than NSC and its affiliates) of USS common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Goldman Sachs in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. The summary of Goldman Sachs’ opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs’ written opinion. Goldman Sachs’ advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the Merger and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of USS common stock should vote with respect to the Merger, or any other matter.
In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

•	certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of USS;
•	certain other communications from USS to its stockholders;
•	certain publicly available research analyst reports for USS; and
•	certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for USS prepared by its management (referred to in this section as the “December 2023 Projections” and which are summarized in the section entitled “Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 64), as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by USS.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of USS regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of USS; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for USS common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for USS with similar information for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the steel industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Board of Directors, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Board of Directors that the December 2023 Projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then available estimates and judgments of the management of USS. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation, appraisal or geological or technical assessment of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of USS or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the Merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of USS to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to USS; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than NSC and its affiliates) of USS common stock, as of the date of its opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Goldman Sachs does not express any view on, and its opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Merger Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Merger, including the fairness of the Merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of USS; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of USS, or class of such persons, in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than NSC and its affiliates) of USS common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the prices at which USS common stock will trade at any time or as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on USS or the Merger, or as to the impact of the Merger on the solvency or viability of USS or the ability of USS to pay its obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, the date of its opinion and Goldman Sachs assumes no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Summary of Financial Analyses
The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 15, 2023, the last trading day before the date on which the Board of Directors approved the Merger and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Using the December 2023 Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on USS to derive a range of illustrative equity values per share of USS common stock. Using the mid-year convention for discounting cash flows and discount rates ranging from 10.75% to 12.50%, reflecting estimates of USS’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value, as of September 30, 2023, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for USS for the period from October 1, 2023 to December 31, 2032, as reflected in the December 2023 Projections and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for USS, which were calculated by applying a range of EV/NTM EBITDA multiples ranging from 3.5x to 6.0x, to an estimate of adjusted EBITDA to be generated by USS in calendar year 2033, as reflected in the December 2023 Projections (which analysis implied perpetuity growth rates ranging from (4.7)% to 2.9%). The range of EV/NTM EBITDA multiples was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account historical trading multiples of USS and certain publicly traded companies, as described below in the section captioned “Selected Publicly Traded Companies Trading Multiples.” Goldman Sachs derived such discount rates by application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (which is referred to in this section as “CAPM”), which requires certain company-specific inputs, including USS’s target capital structure weightings, the cost of long-term debt, after-tax yield on permanent excess cash, if any, future applicable marginal cash tax rate and a beta for USS, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally.
Goldman Sachs derived a range of illustrative enterprise values for USS by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for USS the amount of USS’s net debt (including amounts attributable to tax-effected pension and other post-employment benefits) and non-controlling interest, in each case as of September 30, 2023,as provided by the management of USS and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by USS, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for USS. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of USS common stock as of December 14, 2023, as provided by the management of USS and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by USS, using the treasury stock method, to derive a range of illustrative equity values per share of USS common stock of $38.12 to $52.02.
Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis
Using the December 2023 Projections, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of an illustrative future value per share of USS common stock. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied enterprise value of USS as of December 31 for each of the calendar years 2024 through 2026, by applying a range of illustrative EV/NTM EBITDA multiples of 3.5x to 5.0x to estimates of USS’s one-year forward adjusted EBITDA as of December 31 for each of the calendar years 2024 through 2026, respectively. This illustrative range of EV/NTM EBITDA multiple estimates was derived by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account current and historical EV/NTM EBITDA multiples for USS and certain publicly traded companies, as described below in the section captioned “Selected Publicly Traded Companies Trading Multiples.”
Goldman Sachs then subtracted the amount of USS’s net debt (including amounts attributable to tax-effected pension and other post-employment benefits) and non-controlling interest from the respective

TABLE OF CONTENTS
implied enterprise values in order to derive a range of illustrative equity values for USS as of December 31 for each of the calendar years 2024 through 2026. Goldman Sachs then divided these implied equity values by the projected year-end number of fully diluted outstanding shares of USS common stock for each of the calendar years 2024 through 2026, calculated using information provided by the management of USS and approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by USS, to derive a range of implied future values per share of USS common stock (excluding dividends). Goldman Sachs then added the cumulative dividends per USS common stock expected to be paid to holders of USS common stock through the end of each of calendar years 2024 through 2026, using the December 2023 Projections, to derive a range of implied future values per share of USS common stock (including dividends). By applying an illustrative discount rate of 14.2%, reflecting an estimate of USS’s cost of equity, and, for the dividends only, using a mid-year convention, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of September 30, 2023 both the theoretical future values per share of USS common stock it derived for USS and the estimated dividends to be paid per share of USS common stock through the end of each of calendar years 2024 through 2026. Goldman Sachs derived such discount rate by application of the CAPM, which requires certain company-specific inputs, including a beta for USS, as well as certain financial metrics for the United States financial markets generally. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of USS common stock of $29.62 to $45.67.
Premia Paid Analysis
Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available information, the acquisition premia paid in certain all-cash acquisition transactions announced during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 15, 2023 involving U.S. publicly traded target companies with a transaction value equal to or greater than $1 billion. For each of the 10-year, five-year and three-year periods ended December 15, 2023 (which is referred to in the table below as “L10Y,” “L5Y” and “L3Y” respectively), using publicly available information, Goldman Sachs calculated the median, 25th percentile and 75th percentile average premia of the price paid in the observed transactions relative to the target’s last undisturbed closing share price prior to announcement of the respective transaction. The following table presents the results of this analysis:
Average Premia Paid	L10Y	L5Y	L3Y
Median	31	36	36
25th Percentile	18	20	23
75th Percentile	52	62	54
Based on Goldman Sachs’ review of the foregoing data and its professional judgment and experience, Goldman Sachs applied a reference range of illustrative premia of 18% to 52% to the undisturbed closing price of USS common stock on August 11, 2023 of $22.72. This analysis resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of USS common stock of $26.81 to $34.53.
Selected Publicly Traded Companies Trading Multiples
Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial information of USS to corresponding publicly available financial information and valuation multiples for the following publicly traded companies in the steel industry, which are referred to in this section as the “selected companies”:
•	Cleveland-Cliffs;
•	Nucor; and
•	Steel Dynamics.
Although none of the selected companies are directly comparable to USS, the selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies in the steel industry with certain operations or financial characteristics that, for purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations or financial characteristics of USS.
For each of USS and, using publicly available information, the selected companies, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared (i) the average of EV/NTM EBITDA multiples for the five-year, three-year, two-year and one-year periods ended August 11, 2023, in each case, excluding data from the period March 25, 2020 to January 28, 2021 (which is referred to in the table below as “L5Y,” “L3Y,” “L2Y” and “LTM”

respectively), (ii) the EV/NTM EBITDA of the closing price per share as of August 11, 2023 (which is referred to in the table below as “Undisturbed”) and (iii) the EV/NTM EBITDA of the closing price per share as of December 15, 2023 (which is referred to in the table below as “Current”).
The results of these calculations are summarized as follows:
Average EV/NTM EBITDA

General
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to USS or the Merger.
Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Board of Directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders (other than NSC and its affiliates) of USS common stock. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of USS, Parent, NSC, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
The Merger Consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between USS and NSC and was approved by the Board of Directors. Goldman Sachs provided advice to USS during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific amount of consideration to USS or the Board of Directors or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.
As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Board of Directors in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex C.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and nonfinancial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of USS, NSC, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the Merger. Goldman Sachs acted as a financial advisor to USS in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to USS and its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted

as co-manager with respect to the issuance of unsecured bonds of USS in May 2023; as co-manager with respect to the issuance of unsecured bonds of USS in September 2022; and as co-manager with respect to the tender offer to purchase senior notes of USS and certain of its subsidiaries in September 2022. During the two-year period ended December 18, 2023, Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by Goldman Sachs Investment Banking to USS, and/or its affiliates of approximately $0.4 million. During the two-year period ended December 18, 2023, Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has not been engaged by NSC, Parent or their respective affiliates to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has recognized compensation. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to USS, NSC, Parent and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking may receive compensation.
The Board of Directors selected Goldman Sachs as a financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the Merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 28, 2023, USS engaged Goldman Sachs to act as a financial advisor in connection with its review of strategic alternatives, including with respect to the Merger. The engagement letter between USS and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of approximately $63 million upon the completion of the Merger, approximately $13 million of which was payable upon the announcement of the Merger. The engagement letter between USS and Goldman Sachs also contemplated an independence fee of $22.5 million that would have been payable solely in the event that USS did not enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction by a certain date. In addition, USS has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.
Certain Financial Projections
Except for quarterly guidance, USS does not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclose internal projections as to future performance, earnings or other results beyond the then-current quarterly and/or annual period due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in the ordinary course, USS management prepares a long-term strategic plan, which is periodically updated and reviewed with the Board of Directors, that reflects USS management’s financial and business outlook for USS. In connection with the proposed Merger, USS is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial information of USS, on a standalone basis without giving effect to the Merger, prepared by USS management, solely because, as described below, such financial information was given to the Board of Directors and to each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs in the process leading to the execution of the Merger Agreement. The December 2023 Projections (as defined below) were provided to each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs and approved by USS for their respective use and reliance in connection with each of Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective opinions, as discussed in this proxy statement in the sections entitled “Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” and “Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.”
In July 2023, in connection with the Board of Directors’ regular annual strategic planning process and in connection with the Board of Directors’ consideration and evaluation of the acquisition proposals received as of such time from Company A and Consortium B, USS management prepared certain unaudited, preliminary financial forecasts for USS for fiscal years 2023 through 2028, which USS management also extrapolated through fiscal year 2033 (which we refer to as the “July 2023 Projections”).
Between August and September 2023, as part of the Company’s strategic alternatives review process, including in connection with the Board of Directors’ evaluation of, and Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ preliminary financial analysis of, the various acquisition proposals received as of such time, USS management updated the projections and extrapolations included in the July 2023 Projections to take into account changes in the internal and external business environment, including updates with respect to the passage of time (which we refer to as the “September 2023 Projections”). The September 2023 Projections comprised a “Management Base Plan” and a “Growth Scenario.” The Management Base Plan was based on numerous variables and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to the price of hot-rolled coil, the timing and economics of certain in-flight strategic projects and other operational considerations (e.g., reduction of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
carbon footprint), as well as potential initiatives to increase direct returns to USS stockholders. Relative to the Management Base Plan, the Growth Scenario assumed no changes with respect to the price of hot-rolled coil or direct returns to USS stockholders, but reflected a significantly more aggressive outlook with respect to the timing and realization of additional investments by the Company in strategic projects and additional footprint reduction. USS management believed the Management Base Plan was achievable without undue execution risk relative to the Growth Scenario, which was illustrative in nature and prepared solely for the discussion and analysis of the Board of Directors. The first six years of the Management Base Plan (i.e., fiscal years 2023 through 2028) were made available to all participants in the strategic alternatives review process, and the extrapolated years of fiscal year 2029 through fiscal year 2033 were not provided given the speculative nature of long-term projections and likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized or may change.
In December 2023, USS management made updates to the projections and extrapolations in the Management Base Plan included in the September 2023 Projections related to USS’s actual 2023 performance and its 2024 capital budget (which we refer to as the “December 2023 Projections”). The Board of Directors reviewed the December 2023 Projections in connection with the Board of Directors’ evaluation of the updated proposals to acquire USS, including NSC’s final proposal to acquire USS and the proposed Merger. USS approved Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective use of, and reliance on, the December 2023 Projections in connection with the financial analyses presented by each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, respectively, to the Board of Directors and each of Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective opinions, as discussed in this proxy statement in the sections entitled “Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” and “Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.”
The July 2023 Projections, the September 2023 Projections, and the December 2023 Projections are referred to collectively as the “Company Projections.” USS is including a summary of the Company Projections to provide USS stockholders with access to information that was made available to the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Consideration.
July 2023 Projections
USS management prepared the July 2023 Projections with respect to USS’s business, as a standalone company, for the second half of fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2033. USS’s management provided the Board of Directors with the July 2023 Projections in connection with the Board of Directors’ consideration and evaluation of the acquisition proposals received as of such time from Company A and Consortium B. In addition, the July 2023 Projections were provided to each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs in connection with the preliminary financial analysis presented by Barclays and Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors at the July 23-25, 2023 meeting of the Board of Directors.

September 2023 Projections
USS management prepared the September 2023 Projections with respect to USS’s business, as a standalone company, for the second half of fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2033. USS’s management provided the Board of Directors with the September 2023 Projections as part of the Company’s strategic alternatives review process, including in connection with the Board of Directors’ evaluation of the various acquisition proposals received as of such time. USS management believed the Management Base Plan was achievable without undue execution risk relative to the Growth Scenario, which was illustrative in nature and prepared solely for the discussion and analysis of the Board of Directors. The first six years of the Management Base Plan (i.e., fiscal years 2023 through 2028) were made available to all participants in the strategic alternatives review process, and the extrapolated years of fiscal year 2029 through fiscal year 2033 were not provided given the speculative nature of long-term projections and likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized or may change. In addition, the September 2023 Projections were provided to each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs, who were instructed to utilize the Management Base Plan in connection with the preliminary financial analysis presented by Barclays and Goldman Sachs to the Board of Directors at the September 27, 2023 meeting.

December 2023 Projections
USS management prepared the December 2023 Projections as an update to the Management Base Plan with respect to USS’s business, as a standalone company, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 through fiscal year 2033. USS’s management provided the Board of Directors with the December 2023 Projections as part of the Company’s strategic alternatives review process, including in connection with the Board of Directors’ evaluation of the various acquisition proposals received as of such time, including, in particular, the latest proposals from NSC and Company D. In addition, the December 2023 Projections were provided to each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs and were approved by USS for Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective use and reliance in connection with the financial analyses presented by each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs respectively to the Board of Directors at the December 17, 2023 meeting and each of Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective opinions, as discussed in this proxy statement in the sections entitled “Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” and “Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC”. The July 2023 Projections and the September 2023 Projections were not approved by USS for Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective use and reliance in connection with the financial analyses presented by each of Barclays and Goldman Sachs respectively to the Board of Directors at the December 17, 2023 meeting and each of Barclays’ and Goldman Sachs’ respective opinions, as discussed in this proxy statement in the sections entitled “Opinion of Barclays Capital Inc.” and “Opinion of Goldman Sachs & Co.

Important Information Regarding the Company Projections
The inclusion of the Company Projections or of this summary does not constitute an admission or representation by USS, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Evercore or any other person that the information is material, should not be regarded as an indication that the Board of Directors, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Evercore, USS or its management or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it

to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such. This information is not fact and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company Projections.
The Company Projections include financial measures not prepared using United States generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as “GAAP”), including Adjusted EBITDA, Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow. Please see the tables above for a description of how USS defines these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of the Company Projections in this section. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures used by USS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the Company Projections were based are subjective in many respects and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the dynamics of USS’s industry and based on actual experience and business developments. The Company Projections, while presented with numerical specificity, reflect numerous assumptions with respect to Company performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond USS’s control. The Company Projections constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Forward-Looking Statements,” that could cause the Company Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate or for actual results to differ materially from the Company Projections. As a result, the Company Projections may not be realized and actual results may be significantly higher or lower than projected, and the Company Projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon as such. Because the Company Projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The Company Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared, including the Merger, and some or all of the assumptions that have been made in connection with the preparation of the Company Projections may have changed since the date the Company Projections were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Company Projections will be achieved.
In addition, the Company Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the Company Projections were prepared or as of the date of this proxy statement. None of USS, NSC or any of our or their respective affiliates intends to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update or otherwise revise the Company Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error (except as required by applicable securities laws). These considerations should be taken into account in reviewing the Company Projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.
For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the Special Meeting will be held several months after the Company Projections were prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on the Company Projections set forth above. The summary of the Company Projections is not provided to influence USS stockholders’ decisions regarding whether to vote for the Merger Agreement Proposal or any other proposal. The Company Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in USS’s public filings with the SEC. USS urges all of its stockholders to review its most recent SEC filings for a description of its reported financial results. See the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”
The Company Projections were not prepared with the purpose of, or with a view toward, public disclosure or toward compliance with United States GAAP, published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (which we refer to as “PwC”), USS’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has

The PwC report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to USS’s historical financial information. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.
None of USS or its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any USS stockholder or to Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement or otherwise concerning the Company Projections or regarding USS’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the Company Projections or that the projected results will be achieved.
Interests of USS’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger
In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that USS stockholders approve the transaction and vote in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal, the Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, USS stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of USS have certain interests in the transactions that are or may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of USS stockholders generally. The Board of Directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, including the Merger, and in making their recommendation that USS stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of these interests are quantified in the narrative below, including compensation that may become payable in connection with the Merger to USS’s named executive officers, as described under the section titled “Quantification of Payments and Benefits to USS’s Named Executive Officers — 402(t) Table” (which is the subject of the advisory (non-binding) vote of USS stockholders described in Proposal 2: The Compensation Proposal). The dates used below to quantify these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only in accordance with SEC rules and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.

Treatment of USS Equity Awards
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company RSU Award (or portion thereof).
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company PSU Award (or portion thereof). The total number of shares of USS common stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be based on actual performance for any portion of a Company PSU Award that has been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time but has not yet vested. For any portion of a Company PSU Award that has not been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time, the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be based on deemed achievement of the greater of (1) maximum performance, if required by the applicable award agreement as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (2) actual performance or (3) target performance through the Effective Time.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each Company Option Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled, and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company Option Award to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the positive difference, if any, of the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price of such Company Option Award, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company Option Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming full vesting for any Company Option Award (or portion thereof) that is subject to performance-based vesting). If the exercise price of any Company Option Award (whether vested or unvested) is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option Award will be cancelled without payment and will have no further force or effect.
Each Company DSU Award will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration or such other amount contemplated by the Company DSU Award and settled in accordance with the terms of such award.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Change in Control Severance Plan
USS maintains the Change in Control Severance Plan (which we refer to as the “CIC Plan”), which provides for enhanced severance benefits, in lieu of the benefits provided under other severance plans maintained by USS for the benefit of its employees, for certain executive officers approved by the Compensation Committee & Organization of the USS Board of Directors in the event of certain qualifying terminations in connection with a “Change in Control” (as defined in the CIC Plan) of USS. All current executive officers of USS participate in the CIC Plan. The Merger will constitute a Change in Control for purposes of the CIC Plan.
Under the CIC Plan, the executive officers are entitled to enhanced severance benefits upon a termination of employment, unless such termination is due to the executive officer’s death or disability, by USS for “Cause” or by the executive officer other than for “Good Reason” (as such terms are defined in the CIC Plan), that occurs (a) upon or within 24 months following a Change in Control or (b) prior to a Change in Control if (i) either (x) the executive officer reasonably demonstrates that such termination was at the request of or as a result of actions by a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (y) such termination occurs during a “Potential Change in Control Period” (as defined in the CIC Plan) and (ii) a “409A Change in Control” (as defined in the CIC Plan) occurs within 24 months following such termination of employment.
Upon a qualifying termination in connection with an applicable event, as described above, the CIC Plan provides that the executive officer is entitled to: (a) accrued compensation and benefits through the date of termination, as well as pay equal to the value of the executive officer’s vacation days accrued through the date of termination; (b) a lump sum cash severance payment in an amount equal to a multiple of the executive officer’s annual compensation (ranging from one to two and a half (for Mr. Burritt) times their annual compensation), calculated as the executive officer’s (i) base salary and (ii) the current target under the annual incentive compensation program (or, if higher than the target, the average short-term incentive compensation paid for the prior three years); (c) participate in substantially similar life and health insurance benefits at active employee rates for 36 months following the date of termination; (d) a supplemental retirement benefit equal to the sum of (i) the retirement account contributions that would have been received under the United States Steel Corporation Savings Fund Plan for Salaried Employees and the Company’s related non tax-qualified plans if the executive officer’s employment would have continued for an additional 36 months, plus earnings, and (ii) the amount the executive officer would have received under the United States Steel Corporation Supplemental Retirement Account Program if the executive officer’s employment would have continued for an additional 36 months, plus earnings; (e) a supplemental savings benefit equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount that the executive officer would have been entitled to under the United States Steel Corporation Savings Fund Plan for Salaried Employees, and any related nonqualified savings plan, determined as if the executive officer were fully vested on the date of termination, over (ii) the amount the executive officer is entitled to under the United States Steel Corporation Savings Fund Plan for Salaried Employees, and any related non-qualified savings plan, on the date of termination; (f) reimbursement for legal fees incurred as a result of termination of employment and incurred in contesting or disputing such termination or seeking to enforce any right or benefit under the CIC Plan or in connection with any tax audit relating to Sections 4999 (excise taxes) or 409A (deferred compensation) of the Code; and (g) reimbursement for reasonable costs for outplacement services incurred within two years following the date of termination.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For illustrative purposes only, it is currently estimated that the current executive officers would be entitled to receive, in the aggregate, approximately $34,816,069 in cash severance benefits under the CIC Plan, assuming each of the executive officers experiences a termination without Cause on January 18, 2024 (which is the latest practicable date to determine such amount before the filing of this proxy statement). See the section titled “Quantification of Payments and Benefits to USS’s Named Executive Officers — 402(t) Table” for additional information regarding the amounts that would become payable to each of the named executive officers under the CIC Plan.

Pension Plan Compensation
USS maintains the United States Steel Corporation Plan for Employee Pension Benefits, Revision of 2003 (which we refer to as the “U. S. Steel Pension Plan”) and the United States Steel Corporation Non Tax-Qualified Pension Plan (which we refer to as the “Non Tax-Qualified Pension Plan”). Mr. Buckiso is the only executive officer who is a participant in the U. S. Steel Pension Plan and the Non-Tax Qualified Pension Plan.
Mr. Buckiso is vested in his benefits under the U. S. Steel Pension Plan and would be eligible to receive his benefits upon a termination of employment in connection with the Merger. Benefits under the U.S. Steel Pension Plan may be payable under the Non Tax-Qualified Pension Plan to the extent they are limited by the qualified plan limitations established under the Code. If Mr. Buckiso were placed on layoff status as of the closing of the Merger, he would be eligible to remain on layoff status for a period of up to two years. Having satisfied certain age and service requirements, Mr. Buckiso would be eligible to commence a Rule-of-70/80 early retirement option after one year on layoff.
We estimate that the aggregate value of benefits payable under the U.S. Steel Pension Plan and the Non Tax-Qualified Pension Plan to Mr. Buckiso, assuming he experiences a separation from service on January 18, 2024 (which is the latest practicable date to determine such amount before the filing of this proxy statement) in connection with the Closing, is $1,949,414.
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Arrangements
USS maintains the following non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements: the United States Steel Corporation Supplemental Thrift Program (which we refer to as the “Supplemental Thrift Program”), the United States Steel Corporation Non Tax-Qualified Retirement Account Program (which we refer to as the “Non-Qualified Retirement Account Program”) and the Supplemental Retirement Account Program (which we refer to as the “Supplemental Retirement Account Program” and such programs collectively, the “Deferred Compensation Programs”). All of our executive officers currently have deferral account balances under, or are otherwise eligible to receive retirement benefits pursuant to, one or more of the Deferred Compensation Programs.
The Deferred Compensation Programs generally provide that, upon a separation from service, the executive officer would receive a distribution of his or her account balance(s), or would otherwise be paid a

TABLE OF CONTENTS
retirement benefit subject to attainment of the applicable age and years of service conditions. These amounts are generally paid in a lump sum at the time of the separation from service, subject to any six-month delay that would apply under Section 409A of the Code.
We estimate that the aggregate value of the amounts payable to the executive officers under the Deferred Compensation Programs, assuming each of the executive officers experiences a separation from service on January 18, 2024 (which is the latest practicable date to determine such amount before the filing of this proxy statement) in connection with the Closing, is $10,754,158. For an estimate of the individualized value of the amounts payable under the Deferred Compensation Programs to each of our named executive officers, assuming each of the named executive officers experiences a separation from service on January 18, 2024 (which is the latest practicable date to determine such amount before the filing of this proxy statement) in connection with the Closing, see “— Quantification of Payments and Benefits to USS’s Named Executive Officers — 402(t) Table” below.
Other Compensation Arrangements
In 2022, USS entered into a letter agreement with Ms. Graziano. Ms. Graziano was hired on August 8, 2022, and her offer letter provides for, in addition to her target annual compensation, (i) $1,000,000 in three-year cliff vesting restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, which represents a prorated portion of Ms. Graziano’s Long Term Incentive Plan award for 2022, (ii) $4,000,000 in new hire cash awards, $500,000 of which was payable in 2022 and the remaining $3,500,000 of which was payable in 2023, (iii) $1,000,000 in three-year cliff vesting restricted stock units and $2,000,000 of performance-based restricted stock units as part of a Strategic Transformation Award, all of which have been granted to Ms. Graziano. Under her offer letter, Ms. Graziano is also eligible to receive additional severance benefits if she resigns within one year of the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer in an amount equivalent to what she would be eligible to receive under USS’s Executive Severance Plan.
In August 2020, USS entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Buckiso to provide certain make-whole, retention and other payments in consideration for his continued employment with the Company beyond the date for which he was eligible for an immediate retirement under the U. S. Steel Pension Plan and the Non Tax-Qualified Pension Plan. We estimate that the aggregate value of benefits payable under Mr. Buckiso’s letter agreement to be $1,406,958 as of January 18, 2024 (which is the latest practicable date to determine such amount before the filing of this proxy statement), assuming he remains on layoff for one year and retires on a 70/80 early retirement option, which amounts are in addition to those described above under “Pension Plan Compensation” described above.
Section 280G and 4999 of the Code
In order to preserve compensation-related corporate income tax deductions for USS that might otherwise be disallowed through the application of Section 280G of the Code in connection with the Merger and to mitigate or eliminate the resulting amount of excise tax that may be payable by the “disqualified individuals” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code in certain circumstances, the Board of Directors or the Compensation & Organization Committee of the Board of Directors, as applicable, approved the acceleration into December 2023 of the vesting and payment of certain equity awards, equity-based awards and cash-based awards, as applicable, that otherwise would have been payable to certain employees (including the executive officers) in 2024, as follows:
•	payment of a portion of the employee’s fiscal year 2023 Annual Incentive Compensation Plan bonus that was earned by its terms and otherwise would be payable in 2024, with the remainder eligible to be paid as regularly scheduled;
•	accelerated vesting and settlement of 2021 and 2022 USS restricted stock units subject to time-based vesting restrictions that would otherwise have vested in 2024; and
•	accelerated vesting and settlement in of a portion of 2021 USS restricted stock units subject to “return on capital employed” performance-based vesting restrictions that were earned by their terms and would otherwise have vested in 2024, with the remainder eligible to vest in accordance with the regular vesting schedule.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In approving the accelerated vesting and payment of such awards described above, the Board of Directors or the Compensation & Organization Committee of the Board of Directors, as applicable, considered, among other things, the projected value of the corporate income tax deductions that were available to USS and that might otherwise be lost as a result of the effect of Section 280G of the Code and the benefits to USS of reducing the potential tax burden on the affected employees.
USS may, subject to Parent’s advance review and consent, take further steps to eliminate or mitigate the potential impact of Section 280G and 4999 of the Code on past or future payments to the disqualified individuals by any combination of agreeing (and obtaining any necessary opinion) to treat certain payments as reasonable compensation for services to be rendered, both prior to and following the Closing. No tax or other gross-ups have been or will be provided to any executive, whether related to Section 280G of the Code or otherwise.
Annual Bonus for Fiscal Year 2024
If the Closing occurs following June 30, 2024, each executive officer who is eligible to participate in an annual bonus or commission incentive program will be eligible to receive, on or within thirty days following the Closing, payment of an amount that would be payable under such cash incentive program based on actual performance of the performance goals for fiscal year 2024, based on eligible earnings from January 1, 2024 through the Closing, pro-rated for the period between January 1, 2024 and the Closing and subject to the executive officer remaining employed through the Closing.
Annual Equity Grants for Fiscal Year 2024
The Board of Directors or the Compensation & Organization Committee of the Board of Directors may make grants of Company equity awards in connection with its 2024 annual grant in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice. As of the date of this proxy statement, the 2024 annual grants have not yet been made.
Indemnification Insurance
USS’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage for a period of six years following the effective time under the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies from the Surviving Corporation. This indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Indemnification and Insurance.”
New Compensation Arrangements
Any executive officers and directors who become officers, directors or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide services to the Surviving Corporation may enter into new individualized compensation arrangements and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Parent, any of its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation. As of the date of this proxy statement, no compensation arrangements between such persons and the Surviving Corporation and/or its affiliates have been established or discussed.
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to USS’s Named Executive Officers—402(t) Table
This section and the table below sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the amount of payments and benefits that each of USS’s named executive officers would receive in connection with the Merger, assuming (i) that the Merger were consummated and each such named executive officer experienced a termination of employment without cause on January 18, 2024 (which is the latest practicable date to determine such amount before the filing of this proxy statement); and (ii) a per share price of USS common stock of $55.00, which is the per share Merger Consideration. Except as expressly stated otherwise, the calculations in the table below do not attempt to forecast any adjustments in compensation that may occur following the date of this proxy statement, including additional equity awards, grants or forfeitures that may occur prior to the Effective Time or any equity awards that, by their terms, vest irrespective of the Merger prior to the Effective Time. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, which may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions

(1)	The cash amount payable to the named executive officers eligible to participate in the CIC Plan (which includes all NEOs other than Ms. Breves) is equal to the sum of two times (two and a half in the case of Mr. Burritt) the named executive officer’s annual compensation, calculated as the named executive officer’s (i) base salary and (ii) the current target under the annual incentive compensation program (or, if higher than the target, the average short-term incentive compensation for the prior three years). For purposes of calculating the amount described in subclause (ii), we have assumed an estimated bonus amount for 2023. No amount in respect of pro-rated annual bonuses for 2024 has been included in the table above.
The cash severance amount is a “double-trigger” benefit (i.e., it is contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the closing of the Merger) and is subject to the named executive officer’s execution and effectiveness of a release of claims. The estimated amount of each component of the cash amount is set forth in the table below. For a more detailed description of the payment terms of the cash amounts, see “Change in Control Severance Plan” above.

S. Steel Pension Plan may be payable under the Non Tax-Qualified Pension Plan to the extent they are limited by the qualified plan limitations established under the Code. Mr. Buckiso would also receive his benefits from the Non Tax-Qualified Pension Plan upon an involuntary termination of employment, other than for cause in connection with the Merger (i.e., this would be a double-trigger benefit).

TABLE OF CONTENTS
For all of the named executive officers, the amounts set forth in this table assume that the conditions for payment, including any service requirements and circumstances or consent surrounding such named executive officer’s termination have been met. The non-qualified deferred compensation amounts are double-trigger benefits (i.e., contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the closing of the Merger).
Assuming each of the named executive officers experiences a termination of employment on January 18, 2024 (which is the latest practicable date to determine such amount before the filing of this proxy statement), the value of non-qualified deferred compensation amounts under the Supplemental Thrift Program, the Non-Qualified Retirement Account Program and the Supplemental Retirement Account Program payable to each of Mr. Burritt, Ms. Graziano, Mr. Bruno, Mr. Buckiso and Mr. Holloway is shown on the table below:

(7)	Per the applicable SEC executive compensation disclosure rules, Ms. Breves is considered a named executive officer as of the date of this disclosure. Ms. Breves served as USS’s Chief Financial Officer until August 8, 2022 and resigned from USS as of December 31, 2022. As of the date of this disclosure, Ms. Breves holds outstanding USS equity or equity-based awards which will be subject to the treatment described above.
Financing of the Merger
At the request of USS in order to provide certainty of funds for the Merger, NSC has entered into commitment letters (which we refer to as the “Commitment Letters”), dated as of December 18, 2023, with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (which we refer to as “SMBC”), MUFG Bank, Ltd. (which we refer to as “MUFG”), and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (together with SMBC and MUFG, the “Commitment Parties”), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have committed to provide 12-month senior unsecured term loan facilities totaling an aggregate principal amount of up to the Japanese Yen equivalent of $16.0 billion (which we refer to as the “Bridge Facilities”), to fund the consideration for the Merger (which we refer to as the “Debt Financing”). The funding of the Bridge Facilities provided for in the Commitment Letters is contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions, including (i) the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the Bridge Facilities and (ii) the certification that all conditions precedent in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the Closing Date.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Debt Financing, and NSC, Parent or their affiliates may obtain alternative financing in order to consummate the Merger. In the event that all or any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letters, Parent has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing in an amount sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the Merger on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, no less favorable to Parent, Guarantor and Merger Sub (as determined by Parent in good faith) than the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Commitment Letters.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Closing and Effective Time
The closing of the Merger (which we refer to as the “Closing”) will take place at 10:00 a.m. local time at the offices of Milbank LLP, 55 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001, or remotely, on the third business day after the date on which all conditions to the Closing, which are described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Closing of the Merger” (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other date, time and place as Parent and USS may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing takes place is herein referred to as the “Closing Date.”
Accounting Treatment
The Merger is anticipated to be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, pending final assessment upon closing of the Merger. NSC anticipates it will record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed primarily at their respective fair values at the date of completion of the Merger. Any excess of the transaction deliverables is anticipated to be recorded to goodwill.
Appraisal Rights
This section summarizes Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger. The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Delaware law and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and which may also be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262) and is incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that you exercise your appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Any person contemplating the exercise of such appraisal rights should carefully review the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, which may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262), particularly the procedural steps required to properly demand and perfect such rights. Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for demanding and perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of such rights. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a (i) “stockholder” are to the record holder of USS common stock, (ii) “beneficial owner” are to a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of USS common stock held either in voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, and (iii) “person” are to an individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders and beneficial owners desiring to exercise their right to appraisal must (1) properly deliver a written demand for an appraisal of their shares of USS common stock to USS prior to the stockholder vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) not submit a proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (3) hold of record or beneficially own, as applicable, shares of USS common stock upon the making of a demand under clause (1) and continue to hold or beneficially own, respectively, such shares of USS common stock through the Effective Time;
(4)	not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal of their shares or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the DGCL; and (5) otherwise meet the criteria and follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. However, assuming the shares of USS common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Merger (which we expect to be the case), after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders and beneficial owners of USS common stock who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (x) the total number of shares of USS common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of USS common stock eligible for appraisal or (y) the value of the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement in respect of such total number of shares exceeds $1,000,000. We refer to the conditions described in this paragraph as the “Minimum Conditions.”
Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of

TABLE OF CONTENTS
payment of the judgment; provided, however, that at any time before the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the Surviving Corporation may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares of USS common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of USS common stock as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.
Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for approval and adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the date of the meeting, must notify each of the stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost. This proxy statement constitutes such notice that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL may be accessed without subscription or cost at the Delaware Code Online (available at: https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc09/index.html#262). In connection with the Merger, any person who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such person’s right to do so should review Section 262 carefully. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A person who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal, we believe that if a person considers exercising such rights, that person should seek the advice of legal counsel.
Stockholders and beneficial owners wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of USS common stock must strictly comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. In addition, a stockholder of record, a beneficial owner or the Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.
Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless timely revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, a stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should not return a blank proxy, but rather must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners should consult with their bank, broker or other nominee regarding methods of voting.
Filing Written Demand
Any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to us, before the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of such person’s shares of USS common stock. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. A stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting may constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.
Record Holders
A demand for appraisal by a holder of record must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder’s shares of USS common stock in connection with the Merger. If a

TABLE OF CONTENTS
holder of record is submitting a demand with respect to shares of USS common stock owned of record in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner in such capacity, and if the shares of USS common stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A holder of record, such as a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, who holds shares of USS common stock as nominee or intermediary for one or more beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to shares of USS common stock held for one or more beneficial owners while not exercising appraisal rights for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of USS common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of USS common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of USS common stock held in the name of the holder of record.
Beneficial Owners
A beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares of USS common stock in accordance with the procedures of subsection (d)(1) of Section 262 of the DGCL summarized above, provided, that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares of USS common stock through the Effective Time and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares of USS common stock for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the Surviving Corporation under Section 262 of the DGCL and to be set forth on the Verified List (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Actions After Completion of the Merger”). Although not expressly required by Section 262 of the DGCL, USS reserves the right to take the position that it may require the submission of all information required of a beneficial owner under subsection (d)(3) of Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any person sharing beneficial ownership of the shares of USS common stock for which such demand is submitted. All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL should be mailed or delivered to: Corporate Secretary, United States Steel Corporation, 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219. Demands for appraisal may not be submitted by electronic transmission.
Actions After Completion of the Merger
If the Merger is completed, within 10 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of USS common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and any beneficial owner who has properly demanded appraisal as of the Effective Time, that the Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.
At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party may withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares of USS common stock and accept the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to the shares of USS common stock subject to the withdrawal by delivering to us as the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any person who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of USS common stock held by all our stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and no person should assume that the Surviving Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of USS common

stock. Accordingly, any stockholders or beneficial owners who desire to have their shares of USS common stock appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of USS common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL. The failure of a record holder or beneficial owner of shares of USS common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL could result in the loss of appraisal rights. Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any person who has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of USS common stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which we have received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand on his, her or its own behalf, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). The Surviving Corporation must give this statement to the requesting stockholder or beneficial owner within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.
If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a record holder of shares of USS common stock or a beneficial owner and a copy thereof is served upon the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (which we refer to as the “Verified List”) containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares of USS common stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of USS common stock have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of the stockholders shown on the Verified List at the addresses stated therein. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs of these notices shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.
After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those persons who have complied with Section 262 of USS common stock and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the persons who demanded appraisal of their shares of USS common stock to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any person fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such person.
In addition, assuming that shares of USS common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all persons who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless one of the Minimum Conditions is met.
Determination of Fair Value
After determining the persons entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of USS common stock subject to appraisal, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL that have the effect of limiting the sum on which interest accrues as described above).
In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that shed any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be

TABLE OF CONTENTS
“exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”
Persons considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares of USS common stock as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares of USS common stock and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, “fair value” under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and persons considering exercising appraisal rights should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Neither USS nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement to any holder or beneficial owner of shares of USS common stock exercising appraisal rights, and USS and Parent each reserve the right to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of USS common stock is less than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. If a demand for appraisal is duly withdrawn, a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming that shares of USS common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time) or other requirements imposed by Section 262 of the DGCL to perfect and seek appraisal are not satisfied, then the right to an appraisal will cease.
Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the Verified List may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
The Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the fair value of the shares of USS common stock, together with interest, if any, by the Surviving Corporation to the persons entitled thereto. Payment will be made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Delaware Court of Chancery may order. The Delaware Court of Chancery’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in such court may be enforced.
The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the Verified List who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares of USS common stock entitled to appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of Section 262 of the DGCL or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under Subsection (k) of Section 262 of the DGCL. In the absence of such an order, each party bears its own expenses.
If any person who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of USS common stock under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such person’s right to appraisal, such person’s shares of USS common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement, without interest. A person will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, such person’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming the USS common stock remained listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time)

or if the person delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the person’s demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.
From and after the Effective Time, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares of USS common stock will be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record as of a time prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, if neither of the Minimum Conditions is met (assuming that shares of USS common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the Effective Time), or if the person who has made a demand for appraisal delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares of USS common stock within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such person to an appraisal of such shares will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, no appraisal proceeding shall be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Delaware Court of Chancery made under subsection (j) of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided that this sentence does not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand in respect of some or all of such person’s shares and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger with respect to the shares subject to the withdrawal within 60 days after the Effective Time.
Failure to comply with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of a stockholder’s or beneficial owner’s statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder or beneficial owner wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
The following is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be relevant to holders of shares of USS common stock whose shares of USS common stock are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of USS common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”) (generally, property held for investment). This discussion is based upon the Code, the regulations promulgated under the Code (which we refer to as the “Treasury Regulations”), rulings and other published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax considerations described in this discussion. No advance ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and no opinion of counsel has been or will be rendered, regarding any matter discussed below.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of USS common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•	a corporation, or other entity or arrangement taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•	an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or
•	a trust, if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of the

Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) the trust validly elected to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of USS common stock that is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership (or arrangement treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular holders in light of their particular facts and circumstances, or to USS stockholders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, for example (but not limited to):
•	banks and other financial institutions;
•	mutual funds;
•	insurance companies;
•	brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities;
•	traders in securities subject to a mark-to-market method of tax accounting with respect to shares of USS common stock;
•	regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
•	retirement plans, individual retirement and other deferred accounts;
•	tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies, instrumentalities or other governmental organizations and pension funds;
•	holders that hold shares of USS common stock as part of a “straddle,” hedge, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction or conversion transaction or similar transactions;
•	holders that hold shares of USS common stock as part of a wash sale for tax purposes;
•	U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
•	partnerships, other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “S corporations,” or any other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors in such entities);
•	holders that own or have owned (directly, indirectly or constructively) 5% or more of USS common stock (by vote or value);
•	holders that received their shares of USS common stock in a compensatory transaction, through a tax-qualified retirement plan or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants;
•	U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
•	holders that actually or constructively own an equity interest in Parent following the Merger;
•	holders subject to any applicable minimum tax;
•	holders exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL;
•	holders that are “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies,” as those terms are used in the Code; and
•	persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to USS common stock as a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement.
This discussion does not address any U.S. federal tax considerations other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax (such as estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences) or any state, local or non-U.S. income or non-income tax considerations. In addition, this discussion does not address any considerations arising under the “Medicare” net investment income tax or any considerations in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations and administrative

guidance promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith and any laws, regulations or practices adopted in connection with any such agreement).
If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of shares of USS common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partner and the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships holding shares of USS common stock, and any partners therein, should consult their tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger.
THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE CONTINGENT ON, YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE APPLICATION OF ANY U.S. NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. JURISDICTION, AND YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of USS common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for USS common stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in the Merger and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of USS common stock surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares of USS common stock. Any gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of USS common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of USS common stock.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
•	the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);
•	such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the Merger and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain (net of certain losses) will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or
•	the USS common stock constitutes a United States real property interest (which we refer to as “USRPI”) by reason of USS being or having been a United States real property holding corporation (which we refer to as “USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the Closing Date or the period that the Non-U.S. Holder held the applicable USS common stock (which we refer to as the “relevant period”), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
With respect to the third bullet point above, USS believes it currently is not a USRPHC. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of the Company’s real property interests and other business assets, there can be no assurance that the Company currently is not a USRPHC or has not been a USRPHC in the past. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its USRPIs equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. Even if the Company were a USRPHC, gain arising from the conversion of a Non-U.S. Holder’s shares of USS common stock into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax pursuant to the third bullet point above if the USS common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code) and such Non-U.S. Holder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of the USS common stock throughout the relevant period. Any Non-U.S. Holders that owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of the USS common stock at any time during the relevant period should consult their tax advisors.
Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Generally, information reporting requirements may apply in connection with payments made to holders of shares of USS common stock in connection with the Merger.
Backup withholding of tax (currently, at a rate of 24%) generally will apply to the proceeds received by a holder of shares of USS common stock pursuant to the Merger, unless (i) a U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 providing such U.S. Holder’s correct taxpayer identification number and certifying that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise establishes an exemption, and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder provides a certification of such holder’s non-U.S. status on the applicable IRS Form W-8 or otherwise establishes an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a holder of shares of USS common stock may be refunded or credited against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided, that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger
General
Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement) use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as practicable, including obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Required Approvals, from governmental entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or legal proceeding by, any governmental entity, as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Merger Agreement — Regulatory Approvals

and Related Matters.” These approvals include clearances under the HSR Act and regulatory approvals under the laws of certain other jurisdictions.
U.S. Regulatory Clearances
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until (i) the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated and (ii) any and all agreements with governmental entities with competent jurisdiction over USS or Parent pursuant to which such parties have agreed not to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under the HSR Act have expired or have been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration or termination of a 30-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their HSR Act notification and report forms. If the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “FTC”) or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”) issues a request for additional information and documentary materials (which we refer to as a “Second Request”) prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier or the parties otherwise agree not to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement until a specified time has expired or the agreement has been terminated. Parent may not pull and refile any filing under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law or Foreign Investment Law, without the Company’s prior written consent.
At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to rescind the Merger, to conditionally approve the Merger upon the divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or to impose restrictions on the operations of USS, including by requiring the parties to license or hold separate assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any U.S. state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. We cannot be certain that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.
Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until one of the following events related to CFIUS has occurred: (a) CFIUS has issued a written notice to the parties that it has concluded all action pursuant to Section 721 and has determined that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or (b) CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the United States requesting the President’s decision and either (i) the President has announced a decision not to take any action to suspend or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (ii) the President has not taken any action within 15 days from the date the President received the report from CFIUS; or (c) CFIUS has issued a written notice that the notified transaction is not a “covered transaction” within the meaning of Section 721.
Other Regulatory Clearances
The Merger is also subject to receipt of pending regulatory approvals in the European Union, Mexico, Slovakia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Canada and Serbia under their applicable regulatory laws as amended from time to time.
In each case, the Merger cannot be completed until the parties obtain clearance or approval to consummate the Merger or the applicable waiting or review periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have agreed to cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to make these filings as promptly as practicable. The relevant regulatory authorities could take such actions under the applicable regulatory laws as they deem necessary or desirable, including seeking divestiture of assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights.

Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock entitled to vote thereon is required for approval of the Merger Agreement Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting, (b) abstentions and (c) “broker non-votes” (if any) will each have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Agreement Proposal. Shares of USS common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a USS stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of USS common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting, and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Agreement Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
THE MERGER AGREEMENT
The following summarizes the provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should carefully read and consider the entire Merger Agreement, which is the legal document that governs the Merger, because this summary may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (a) were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (b) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (c) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by USS, Parent, Merger Sub and, solely for the purposes of Section 9.13 therein, Guarantor in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between USS, Parent, Merger Sub and. solely for the purposes of Section 9.13 therein, Guarantor rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. USS stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of USS, Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor (solely for the purposes of Section 9.13 therein) or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of USS, Parent, Merger Sub and, solely for the purposes of Section 9.13 therein, Guarantor, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letters to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding USS, Parent, Merger Sub, or, solely for the purposes of Section 9.13 therein, Guarantor or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding USS and our business.
Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws

Subject to applicable law, the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal, in each case, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals as designated by Parent prior to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal, in each case, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

will be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or as provided by applicable law.
Closing and Effective Time
The Closing will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Milbank LLP, 55 Hudson Yards, New York, New York 10001, or remotely by exchange of documents and signatures (or their electronic counterparts) on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of all conditions to Closing, which are described below in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Conditions to the Closing of the Merger,” (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other place, time and date as USS and Parent may agree in writing.
At the Closing, USS, Parent and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and will make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger will become effective at such time as the certificate of merger with respect to the Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by USS and Parent and specified in the certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL.
Merger Consideration
USS Common Stock
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of USS, Parent, Merger Sub, or the holders of any securities of USS or Merger Sub, each share of USS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (a) each share that is owned by USS or any wholly owned subsidiary of USS as treasury stock or otherwise, but including for the avoidance of doubt any shares of USS common stock held by any Company Employee Plan or trust related thereto (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under any of the Company Equity Plans) or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and (b) shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the shares described in the foregoing clause (a)) and that are held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or consented thereto in writing and are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of such shares, as applicable, pursuant to, and who have properly exercised and perfected their demands for appraisal rights under and comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL) will be converted automatically into the right to receive $55.00 in cash, subject to any required tax withholding.
Treatment of USS Equity Awards
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company RSU Award (or portion thereof).
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends

TABLE OF CONTENTS
corresponding to such vested Company PSU Award (or portion thereof). The total number of shares of USS common stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be based on actual performance for any portion of a Company PSU Award that has been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time but has not yet vested. For any portion of a Company PSU Award that has not been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time, the total number of shares of USS common stock subject to a Company PSU Award will be based on deemed achievement of the greater of (1) maximum performance, if required by the applicable award agreement as of the date of the Merger Agreement, (2) actual performance or (3) target performance through the Effective Time.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, USS or any other person, each Company Option Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and be cancelled, and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company Option Award to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the positive difference, if any, of the Merger Consideration minus the applicable exercise price of such Company Option Award, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of USS common stock subject to such Company Option Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming full vesting for any Company Option Award (or portion thereof) that is subject to performance-based vesting). If the exercise price of any Company Option Award (whether vested or unvested) is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option Award will be cancelled without payment and will have no further force or effect.
Each Company DSU Award will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration or such other amount contemplated by the Company DSU Award and settled in accordance with the terms thereof.
Exchange and Payment Procedures
On the Closing Date, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that will be appointed by Parent to act as a paying agent under the Merger Agreement and approved in advance by USS in writing (which we refer to as the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of holders of the shares of USS common stock, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the shares of USS common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of USS common stock (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or noncertificated shares of USS common stock represented by book-entry (which we refer to such cash as the “Exchange Fund”). In the event that the Exchange Fund has insufficient funds to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent will as promptly as reasonably practicable deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the shortfall that is required to make such payment.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second business day following the Closing Date, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares represented by Certificates whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to certificates will pass, only upon delivery of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and USS may mutually reasonably agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares represented by such holder’s properly surrendered certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and (y) the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the later to occur of (a) the Effective Time, and (b) to the extent required by the Paying Agent, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to issue and deliver to each

holder of book-entry shares a check or wire transfer for an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares that are represented by such holder’s book-entry shares and (ii) the Merger Consideration, in each case, without such holder being required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such book-entry shares will then be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or cancellation of book-entry shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares that is not registered in the transfer records of USS, payment of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of a certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the certificate formerly representing such shares is presented to the Paying Agent, in proper form for transfer, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. In the case of any certificate of USS common stock that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, compliance with the procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, and, if required by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate a check in the amount of the number of shares of USS common stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that, as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time, remains undistributed to the former holders of shares will thereafter be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of such shares who have not surrendered their shares of USS common stock must thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their shares of USS common stock. Any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the former holders of shares of USS common stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity will become, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
Withholding
The Paying Agent, USS, Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates or agents), as applicable, and any other applicable withholding agent (without duplication) will be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amounts otherwise payable under the Merger Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or under any provision of applicable U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant governmental entity within the time and in the manner required by applicable law, such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of the Merger Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any compensatory amounts payable to any current or former employee of USS or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to or as contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be remitted to the applicable payor for payment to the applicable person or entity through regular payroll procedures, as applicable, or, at the election of USS, through a payroll agent, in either case subject to any required deductions or withholdings.
Representations and Warranties
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of USS, Parent, Merger Sub and Guarantor. Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by USS are qualified as to materiality or “Company Material Adverse Effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect” means an event, change, occurrence, effect, condition or development that, individually or in the aggregate with all other events, changes, occurrences, effects, conditions or developments, (i) has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, properties, results of operations or financial condition of USS and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of USS to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby (other than any

Notwithstanding the foregoing, USS has agreed that it (A) will not modify, amend or terminate, or waive, release, or assign any standstill provisions or similar agreements with any person and (B) will enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreements; provided, that USS may waive any standstill or similar agreement solely to the extent necessary to allow for an Alternative Proposal to be made to the Board of Directors in a confidential manner so long as USS promptly notifies Parent thereof (including the identity of such counterparty) concurrently with granting any such waiver.
During the Pre-Closing Period, USS has agreed that it will (i) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours of receipt) notify Parent (orally and in writing) of the receipt by USS or any of its subsidiaries or their respective Representatives of any proposal, offer, inquiry or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, an Alternative Proposal, which notice will include a summary of the material terms and conditions of (and the identity of the person making) such proposal, offer, inquiry or request and will include with such notice copies of such proposal, offer, inquiry or request and copies of any other documents, in each case, evidencing or specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or request, in each case, to the extent provided in writing and (ii) thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt (and, in any event within twenty-four hours) basis of any material developments with respect to, or any material change to the terms of, any such Alternative Proposal, including by providing copies of any additional draft agreements relating to, or written proposals containing any material term of, any such Alternative Proposal received by USS, any of its affiliates or any of their respective Representatives.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, USS receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal, which Alternative Proposal did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, and the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with USS’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) such Alternative Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, USS may take the following actions:
•	furnish information, including material non-public information, to any person making such Alternative Proposal, as well as its Representatives and potential financing sources, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, such person has executed a confidentiality agreement with USS having provisions as to confidential treatment of information that are not materially less favorable in any substantive respect to USS than the confidentiality provisions in Parent’s confidentiality agreement (it being understood that (A) any confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill,” employee non-solicitation or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Alternative Proposal and (B) any confidentiality agreement will not prohibit USS from satisfying its obligations under the Merger Agreement) (provided, that USS will, prior to or concurrently with such disclosure, make available to Parent any non-public information that is made available to such person to the extent not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives); and
•	engage in discussions or negotiations with any person (as well as its Representatives) with respect to the Alternative Proposal.

“Alternative Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer made by any person (other than Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates) relating to or concerning (i) the direct or indirect acquisition by any person of (including through the acquisition of any equity interests of one or more subsidiaries of USS comprising) (A) 20% or more of the assets of USS and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or (B) assets of USS and its subsidiaries to which 20% or more of the revenues or earnings of USS and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are attributable for the most recent fiscal year for which the audited financial statements are then available (other than, in each case, sales of inventory, leases and nonexclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business) or (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any person (including by way of merger, reorganization, division, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction), or a tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning, 20% or more of the total voting power of the equity securities of USS (or any direct or indirect parent company thereof), as applicable, immediately following such transaction, in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), whether in a single or series of related transactions.
“Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Alternative Proposal, substituting in the definition thereof “50%” for “20%” in each place it appears, made after the date of the Merger Agreement that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with USS’s outside financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the Board of Directors considers to be relevant (including the conditionality, timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal, as well as, to the extent third party financing is contemplated, the nature of such financing and any commitments with respect thereto, and whether such proposal is reasonably capable of being satisfied in accordance with its terms (if accepted)), to be more favorable from a financial point of view to USS’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation
As described in this proxy statement, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the USS stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement (which we refer to as the “Recommendation”).

USS has agreed that the Board of Directors, including any committee thereof, will not, directly or indirectly:
•	withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in any manner adverse to Guarantor, Parent of Merger Sub), or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in any manner adverse to Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the Recommendation;
•	approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Alternative Proposal;
•	fail to include the Recommendation in this proxy statement;
•	fail to publish, send or provide to the holders of shares of USS common stock, pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act a statement recommending against any Alternative Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer and publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within ten business days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or fail to maintain such recommendation against such offer at any time before such offer has expired or been withdrawn;
•	if an Alternative Proposal (other than an Alternative Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer) shall have been publicly announced or disclosed, fail to recommend against such Alternative Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Recommendation on or prior to the earlier of ten Business Days after such Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed and two Business Days prior to the Special Meeting; or
•	resolve to effect or publicly announce an intention to effect any of the foregoing (we refer to any of the foregoing actions as a “Change of Recommendation”).

At any time prior to obtaining the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Alternative Proposal received by USS after the date of the Merger Agreement that has not been subsequently withdrawn, which Alternative Proposal did not result from a material breach of the nonsolicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, and with respect to which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with USS’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (1) such Alternative Proposal would if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, make a Change of Recommendation, and/or, in certain specified circumstances, terminate the Merger Agreement, provided, that the Board of Directors will not be entitled to make a Change of Recommendation or cause any such termination of the Merger Agreement unless, in each case:
•	USS has given Parent at least five business days’ written notice (which we refer to as a “Superior Proposal Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such Change of Recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement, which notice must include a description of the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person making such proposal and copies of any other documents evidencing or specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal;
•	during such five-business day period, if requested by Parent, USS, its subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent so desires to negotiate) to consider amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a manner so that such Alternative Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and
•	at the end of such five-business day period, after taking into account any irrevocable commitments or binding proposals made by Parent to USS in writing to amend the terms of the Merger Agreement during such period and in consultation with USS’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors determines that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that in the event of any material modification of the financial terms or any other material modifications to the terms of such Superior Proposal, USS will deliver a new written notice to Parent and comply with the requirements set forth in the first bullet with respect to such new written notice, except that the new notice period will be three business days.
At any time prior to obtaining the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, the Board of Directors may, in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in this section of this proxy statement) that is continuing, make a Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with USS’s financial advisors and legal counsel that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, that the Board of Directors will not be entitled to make such a Change of Recommendation unless:
•	USS has given Parent at least five business days’ written notice (which we refer to as “Intervening Event Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such an Change of Recommendation, which Intervening Event Notice must include a description of the applicable Intervening Event;
•	to the extent requested by Parent during such five-business day period, USS, its subsidiaries and their respective Representatives will have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent so desires to negotiate) to consider amendments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement in such a manner that would permit the Board of Directors, consistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties, not to make such Change of Recommendation; and

TABLE OF CONTENTS
•	at the end of such five-business day period, after taking into account any irrevocable commitments or binding proposals made by Parent to USS in writing to amend the terms of the Merger Agreement during such five-business day period, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with USS’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to make such Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law (it being understood that any such determination in and of itself will not be deemed a Change of Recommendation).
Nothing in the Merger Agreement will prohibit the Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable law or NYSE and CSE rules and regulations, including taking or disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder (and no communication that consists solely of a “stop, look and listen” statement, in and of itself, will be considered a Change of Recommendation) or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that such disclosure is required by applicable law; provided, that no disclosure or communication will be permitted pursuant to the foregoing sentence that constitutes a Change of Recommendation or will require the giving of a Superior Proposal Notice or an Intervening Event Notice except in accordance with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement. For the purposes of the Merger Agreement, a public statement by USS or the Board of Directors that describes the receipt of an Alternative Proposal, the identity of the person making such Alternative Proposal, the material terms of such Alternative Proposal and the operation of the Merger Agreement with respect thereto (that does not otherwise indicate or suggest that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal) will not be deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, modification or proposal by the Board of Directors to withhold, withdraw, or modify, the Recommendation; (B) an approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability with respect to such Alternative Proposal; or (C) a Change of Recommendation.
“Intervening Event” means any event, change, occurrence, development, condition, effect or state of facts or circumstances that (i) is material to USS and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) was unknown to, and not reasonably foreseeable by, the Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or if known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors as of the date of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) does not involve or relate to (A) an Alternative Proposal or (B) the fact that USS and its subsidiaries exceed any published analyst estimates or expectations of USS’s revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any period, in and of itself, or exceed any internal or published projections, budgets, plans or forecasts of revenues, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations, in and of itself, or any change in the price or trading volume of the shares of USS common stock or the credit rating of USS (provided, that for purposes of clause (B), the matters giving rise to or contributing to such events may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been, an Intervening Event).
Employee Matters
For one year following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, the applicable employee’s period of employment following the Closing Date), Parent will provide or cause to be provided to each employee of USS and its subsidiaries who is employed immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed following the Effective Time (each of whom we refer to as a “Company Employee”):
•	base salary or wage rate (as applicable) and an annual target cash incentive opportunity (excluding severance, any change in control, retention or transaction bonus payments, and any equity or equitybased incentive opportunity or arrangement) that, in each case, is no less favorable than were provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; and
•	broad-based employee health, welfare, and retirement benefits (excluding defined benefit pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, and retiree or other post-employment health and welfare benefits) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, Parent will provide or cause to be provided to each Company Employee who incurs a qualifying termination of employment during the one-year period following the Effective Time with severance benefits equal to the severance benefits that would have been provided to such Company Employee under the Company’s severance arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and previously disclosed to Parent.
However, any Company Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall not be provided with compensation and benefits as outlined immediately above, but instead will be provided with compensation and benefits in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) recognize each Company Employee’s service with USS and its subsidiaries and their respective predecessors prior to the Effective Time for all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits (other than defined benefit pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, and retiree or other post-employment health and welfare benefits)) under any applicable Parent employee benefit plan to the same extent such service was recognized under a corresponding USS employee benefit plan, and provided that such recognition of service would not result in a duplication of benefits, (b) cause any eligibility waiting periods to be waived for each Company Employee under any and all Parent employee benefit plans to the extent coverage under such Parent employee benefit plan is comparable to a USS employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time, and (c) for purposes of each Parent employee benefit plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, (i) waive all pre-existing condition limitations and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent employee benefit plan for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate in such Parent employee benefit plan towards applicable deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements for any eligible expenses incurred by the Company Employee.
Debt Financing
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has agreed to, and to cause Guarantor and their respective subsidiaries, Representatives and controlled affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Debt Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with and maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters (including any “flex” provisions applicable to the Debt Financing) or on such other terms and conditions satisfactory to Guarantor or otherwise not less favorable to Guarantor and its controlled affiliates (as determined by Guarantor in good faith) than the terms and conditions contained in the applicable Commitments Letters, (iii) satisfy, at or prior to the Closing, all conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing to the extent within Guarantor’s or its respective controlled affiliates’ control and assist in the satisfaction of all other conditions to the Debt Financing and definitive agreements entered into with respect to the Commitment Letters, (iv) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters, to consummate the Debt Financing at Closing and (v) enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters and the definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing.
In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, each of Parent and Merger Sub has agreed to, and to cause Guarantor and their respective controlled affiliates to, promptly notify USS in writing and (i) use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from the same or alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, no less favorable to Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters, that do not include any conditions to the consummation thereof that are more onerous than those set forth in the Commitment Letters (which we refer to as the “Alternative Financing”) and (ii) obtain and deliver a debt commitment letter to USS with respect to such Alternative Financing, including true, correct and complete copies of any related executed fee letters (subject to customary redactions), engagement letters or other agreements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has agreed (i) to provide USS with prompt written notice of any (A) material breach or material default or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (or would reasonably be expected to) give rise to any material default or material breach by any party to the Commitment Letters of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, including the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any lender or other financing source with respect to any material breach or material default (or alleged material breach or material default) by any party to the Commitment Letters, in each case, that would materially delay or prevent the Closing, (B) written withdrawal, repudiation or termination or threatened in writing withdrawal, repudiation or termination thereof of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, or (C) incurable event or circumstance that makes a condition precedent relating to the Debt Financing unable to be satisfied (in the good faith determination of Parent) by any party of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware and (ii) notify USS promptly if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub no longer believes in good faith that it or Guarantor, as applicable, will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters from the sources described therein and (iii) upon reasonable request of USS, otherwise keep USS reasonably and promptly informed of the status of the efforts of Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub to arrange the Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing).
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has agreed that in no event will the availability, the terms nor the obtaining of Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing, nor the completion of any issuance of securities be a condition to the Merger, the Closing or the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
USS Indebtedness
USS has agreed to permit Parent or Merger Sub to commence and conduct one or more offers to purchase, including any “Change of Control Offer” or any offer in connection with a “Fundamental Change” any tender offer or any exchange offer, and/or to conduct a consent solicitation, if any (each of which we refer to as a “Debt Offer” and collectively, the “Debt Offers”) with respect to any or all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes under the USS indentures. The closing of any such Debt Offer will not be consummated prior to the Closing and will be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing; however, the consummation of any such Debt Offer will not be a condition to Parent’s obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In no event will USS or any of its subsidiaries be required to incur any financing or provide assistance in obtaining any financing for a Debt Offer.
If requested by Parent, USS has agreed to, and shall cause its subsidiaries and direct their respective Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to (x) obtain any waivers and/or consents with respect to any “Change of Control” or “Fundamental Change” provisions contained in any USS indentures or USS credit facilities and (y) enter into any amendments and/or supplements to the USS credit facilities or USS indentures in connection therewith, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause the agents, trustees, holders and/or lenders under the applicable USS credit facilities to enter into such amendments and/or supplements, which shall become operative before or substantially simultaneously with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as determined by Parent.
If requested by Parent, in lieu of or in addition to Parent commencing Debt Offers for the notes under the USS indentures, USS has agreed to (i) send any notices of redemption with respect to all or a portion of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes under the USS indentures, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be required under the applicable USS indenture to cause the applicable trustee to proceed with the redemption of the applicable notes under the USS indentures and to provide the applicable notice of redemption and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver all other documents required under the applicable USS indenture (including any officer’s certificates and legal opinion) to issue notices of redemption (together with the Debt Offers, the “Repayments”).
USS has agreed, and shall cause its subsidiaries and direct their respective Representatives, in each case, to use its and their reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation, at Parent’s sole cost and expense, reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with any Repayments, including by (i) causing the applicable trustee or lender to agree to proceed with the Repayments, (ii) waiving any conditions to the Repayments as may be reasonably requested by Parent that may be legally waived and may be waived

The cooperation and other obligations contemplated by this paragraph shall not require (i) USS to cooperate with respect to any Debt Offer that would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the terms of the applicable USS indenture or applicable law, (ii) USS or any of its officers, directors or other Representatives to authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other agreement that would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the terms of the applicable USS indentures, the applicable USS credit facilities or applicable law or that would become operative before the Closing Date, or (iii) USS’s legal counsel to give any opinion that is not required pursuant to the applicable USS credit facilities or the applicable USS indentures or any opinion that, in the opinion of such legal counsel, does not comply with applicable laws.
Cooperation as to Debt Financing

•	ensure that an officer of USS executes prior to the Closing customary “authorization” letters in connection with bank information memoranda authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders; and

•	require USS or any of its subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to:
•	other than the “authorization” letter contemplated above, execute, deliver, enter into, approve or perform any agreement, commitment, document, certificate or instrument, or modification of any agreement, commitment, document, certificate or instrument or incur any other actual or potential liability or obligation relating to the Debt Financing, in each case, that becomes effective prior to the Closing;

connection with (i) such cooperation, (ii) the Debt Financing, (iii) any information used in connection therewith, subject to certain exceptions, and (iv) any action taken by them at the request of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the above provisions, except, in each case, to the extent such losses, damages, claims, costs (including cost of investigation), settlement payments, injuries, liabilities, judgments, awards, penalties, fines, or expenses (including outside attorneys’ fees and disbursements) arose from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by USS, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives, as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or the inaccuracy of information provided by, or on behalf of, USS or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Debt Financing.
Guaranty
Guarantor has agreed to absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee, as principal and not as surety, to USS, the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns the due and punctual payment and performance of each of the Guaranteed Obligations. The guaranty is one of payment and performance, not merely collection, and any breach or nonperformance of any such obligations of Merger Sub or Parent (or any of their successors or assigns) shall also be deemed to be a default of Guarantor. For so long as the guaranty remains in effect, Guarantor will not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of its performance of its guaranty, whether by subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, contribution or otherwise, against USS, the Surviving Corporation or their successors and assigns or any express intended third party beneficiary of any Guaranteed Obligations, or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Subject to the provisions of the guaranty, including the limitations contained therein, the guaranty is a continuing one and remains in full force and effect until the Guaranteed Obligations have been performed or satisfied. The Guaranteed Obligations will be discharged as a result of (i) indefeasible payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, or (ii) those defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that Parent or Merger Sub has (A) arising from fraud or willful breach by USS or (B) under the specific terms of the Merger Agreement.
As a separate and independent stipulation, any of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any monies payable) that is or becomes unenforceable against, or not capable of recovery from, Parent or Merger Sub by reason of any legal limitation, disability or incapacity on or of Parent or Merger Sub or any other fact or circumstances (other than any limitation imposed by the Merger Agreement) will nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by Guarantor and Guarantor were the sole or principal obligor in respect of that Guaranteed Obligation.
Indemnification and Insurance
Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of USS or its subsidiaries (or directors or officers of USS or any of its subsidiaries to the extent serving as fiduciaries with respect to any Company Employee Plan maintained by USS or any of its subsidiaries) as provided in their respective articles or certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents or in any contract (including indemnification agreements set forth in the USS disclosure letter) of USS or its subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and will continue at and after the Effective Time in full force and effect. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of USS’s and any of its subsidiaries’ articles or certificates of incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any contract, including indemnification agreements set forth in the USS disclosure letter, of USS or its subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of USS or any of its subsidiaries.
For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing or any related expenses) each current and former director, officer or employee of USS or any of its

subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of USS or its subsidiaries (or directors or officers of USS or any of its subsidiaries to the extent serving as fiduciaries with respect to any Company Employee Plan), in each case, at or prior to the Effective Time against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any action to the fullest extent permitted by law), liabilities and losses, reasonably incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of USS or its subsidiaries).
For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of USS and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for USS and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of USS and its subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of USS and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (regardless of when such claims are brought) (with insurance carriers having the same or better A.M. Best financial rating as USS’s current directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance carriers), except that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by USS and its subsidiaries. If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain such insurance because its cost exceeds such maximum amount, it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for a premium equal to such maximum amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date USS may, at its option, purchase, or Parent may, at its option request that USS, purchase a six-year prepaid “tail” directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance policy for USS and its subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of USS and its subsidiaries, such tail policy to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of USS and its subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, that USS will not pay an aggregate amount for such policy in excess of the maximum amount set forth above.
Special Meeting
USS has agreed, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement (and no later than 25 business days after the date of the Merger Agreement), that USS will:
•	prepare and file with the SEC this proxy statement, which, subject to the right of the Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”), will include the recommendation that USS stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement;
•	use reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of this proxy statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after the receipt thereof; and
•	cause the definitive proxy statement to be mailed to USS’s stockholders as promptly as practicable following the time this proxy statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to USS’s stockholders (and in any event within ten business days after such time).

USS has also agreed that it will:
•	subject to the other provisions of the Merger Agreement, take all action required by the NYSE, the CSE and the SEC rules and as required by the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting promptly (but in no event later than 45 days following the mailing of this proxy statement) for the purpose of obtaining (A) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock, and (B) if so desired and mutually agreed between USS and Parent, a vote upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of stockholders in connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by such agreement, provided, that the foregoing obligations shall not be affected by a Change of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that in the event of a Change of Recommendation, USS shall have no obligation to solicit proxies to obtain the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock under the following bullet); and
•	subject to the right of the Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation”), use reasonable best efforts to obtain the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the USS stockholders and solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the USS stockholders.
USS may adjourn, recess, or postpone, and at the request of Parent it will adjourn, recess or postpone, the Special Meeting for a reasonable period to solicit additional proxies, if USS or Parent, respectively, reasonably believes there will be insufficient shares of USS common stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting or to obtain the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the USS stockholders (provided, that unless agreed in writing by USS and Parent, all such adjournments, recesses or postponements will be for periods of no more than ten business days each (not to exceed 20 business days in the aggregate without Parent’s written consent)) and (y) USS may adjourn, recess, or postpone the Special Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to this proxy statement is provided to the USS stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Special Meeting. USS will use its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent with periodic updates (including voting reports) concerning proxy solicitation results, as reasonably requested by Parent.
See the section of this proxy statement entitled “The Board of Directors’ Recommendation; Change of Recommendation” for related information regarding the Board of Directors’ responsibilities with regard to recommending the adoption of the Merger Agreement to USS stockholders.
Transaction Litigation
During the Pre-Closing Period, USS will control the defense of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against USS and/or its directors relating to the Merger Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (whether directly or on behalf of USS and its subsidiaries or otherwise); provided, that USS will promptly notify Parent of any such legal proceeding and keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof, give Parent the right to participate in, and the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with, any such legal proceeding (and shall give due consideration to Parent’s comments and other advice with respect to such legal proceeding, including with respect to strategy and any significant decisions related thereto), and give Parent the opportunity to consult on the settlement, release, waiver or compromise of any such legal proceeding, provided, that neither USS nor its subsidiaries will be required to provide, or cause to be provided, any information the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege, provided, that USS shall use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to allow access in a manner that does not result in waiver of such privilege. USS shall in good faith take such comments into account, and no such settlement, release, waiver or compromise of such litigation shall be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Termination Fee Payable by Parent
Parent has agreed, if requested by USS, to pay to USS a termination fee of $565 million in cash (which we refer to as the “Parent Termination Fee”) if:
•	the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent or USS pursuant to the End Date Termination Right and, at the time of such termination (A) one or more of the conditions to Closing related to (i) regulatory approvals or (ii) the absence of legal restraints preventing the consummation of the Merger (only to the extent the applicable legal restraint is issued or granted in respect of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by a governmental entity in the U.S. or certain specified jurisdictions pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust law, foreign investment law or CFIUS or the President of the United States) have not been satisfied or waived, (B) the condition requiring approval of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock has been satisfied and (C) all other obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (if such conditions would be satisfied were the Closing to occur at such time)); or
•	the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent or USS pursuant to the Legal Restraint Termination Right, only as the result of a legal restraint issued or granted in respect of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by a governmental entity in the U.S. or certain specified jurisdictions pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust law or foreign investment law or CFIUS or the President of the United States and, at the time of such termination, the condition requiring approval of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of USS common stock has been satisfied and one or more of the conditions set forth in (x) the No Legal Restraints Condition (only as the result of a legal restraint issued or granted in respect of the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby by (i) a governmental entity in the U.S. or certain specified jurisdictions pursuant to the HSR Act or applicable antitrust law or foreign investment law or (ii) CFIUS or the President of the United States) and (y) the Regulatory Approvals Condition, have not been satisfied or waived, and all of the other obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (if such conditions would be satisfied were the Closing to occur at such time)).
Promptly following a termination as described above, the Company will irrevocably elect in writing to accept or decline the Parent Termination Fee (which we refer to as the “Company Election”). If the Company has declined the Parent Termination Fee, the Company Election will constitute an irrevocable waiver of the Parent Termination Fee. The Company’s right to receive payment from Parent of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to the Merger Agreement against any of the Parent Related Parties or any Debt Financing Source for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform under the Merger Agreement or otherwise, except in the case of a willful breach of the Merger Agreement or fraud by Parent or Merger Sub (in which case the Company will be entitled to seek monetary damages, recovery or award from Parent or Merger Sub). However, in no event will any of the Parent Related Parties be liable for monetary damages, recovery or award for willful breach of the Merger Agreement or fraud arising out of any matter forming the basis for such termination if the Company has elected to accept the Parent Termination Fee in the Company Election.
In no event will Parent be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

Specific Enforcement
Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, any and all remedies therein expressly conferred upon a party are deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred by the Merger Agreement or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties have agreed that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of the Merger Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including any party failing to take such actions as are required of it under the Merger Agreement in order to consummate the transactions contemplated thereunder). Each party has agreed that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement, the non-breaching party will be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each party has agreed that the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to termination fees are not intended to and do not adequately compensate USS, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of the Merger Agreement, and are not construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief. The pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable remedy by any party will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in equity) to which such party may be entitled at any time, subject to the limitations or remedies set forth in the Merger Agreement. In circumstances where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledged and agreed that USS and its stockholders will have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate USS and its stockholders, and that USS on behalf of itself and its stockholders will be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to enforce specifically Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger.
Each party agreed not to raise any objection to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance in accordance with and subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement or to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement on the basis that there is adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Each party further agreed that no other party or any other person will be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to specific enforcement, and each party irrevocably waived any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
The parties have acknowledged and agreed that time is of the essence and that the parties would suffer ongoing irreparable injury for so long as any provision of the Merger Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms, including but not limited to as a result of any dispute over the parties’ obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The parties accordingly agreed that, as to any actions or legal proceedings in which a party seeks specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties will use their reasonable best efforts to seek and obtain an expedited schedule for such proceedings and will not oppose any party’s request for expedited proceedings.
Each party further agreed that by seeking the remedies provided for in the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to specific enforcement, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may be available to a party under the Merger Agreement, and nothing set

TABLE OF CONTENTS
forth in the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to specific enforcement will require any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party’s rights to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to specific enforcement prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under the Merger Agreement, nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to specific enforcement or anything set forth in the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to specific enforcement restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement or pursue any other remedies under the Merger Agreement, the Commitment Letters or otherwise in connection with the Debt Financing that might be available then or thereafter (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in connection with the Debt Financing).
While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent expressly permitted by the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to specific performance and the payment of other monetary damages, subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to the effect of termination and termination fees, under no circumstances will Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to both specifically perform the terms of the Merger Agreement and pay other monetary damages.
Expenses
Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such expense, except that expenses incurred by any party in connection with the printing, filing and mailing of this proxy statement (including applicable SEC filing fees) will be borne equally by USS and Parent, and all filing fees paid by any party in respect of any HSR Act or other regulatory filing will be borne by Parent. Except as otherwise described under the section of this proxy statement entitled “Exchange and Payment Procedures,” all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar taxes (for the avoidance of doubt, not including income, capital gain, gross receipt and other similar taxes) imposed on USS or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the Merger (including such taxes that are also imposed on any holder of shares of USS common stock with respect to the transfer of shares of USS common stock as joint and several liability) shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.
Amendments and Waivers
At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the USS stockholders, any provision of the Merger Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by USS, Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that after the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the USS stockholders, if any such amendment or waiver requires, pursuant to applicable law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE or the CSE, further approval of the USS stockholders or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, as applicable, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver will be subject to the approval of the USS stockholders or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, as applicable. The foregoing notwithstanding, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right under the Merger Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right thereunder. Select provisions relating to the Debt Financing may not be amended or waived in a manner adverse in any material respect to the Debt Financing Sources without the written consent of the Debt Financing Sources party to the Commitment Letters.

PROPOSAL 2: THE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL
Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, USS is required to submit a proposal to USS stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to USS’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Compensation Proposal). Such compensation is summarized and quantified in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Interests of USS’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.” The Board of Directors encourages you to carefully review the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, USS is asking you to approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the USS stockholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation that will or may become payable to USS’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled “Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement — Interests of USS’s Executive Officers and Directors in the Merger.”
The vote on this Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger Agreement Proposal and vote not to approve the Compensation Proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on USS. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement Proposal is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on this Compensation Proposal.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of USS common stock representing a majority of the votes cast by USS stockholders present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Compensation Proposal.
Assuming a quorum is present, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal, (b) abstentions will have no effect on the Compensation Proposal and (c) “broker non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Compensation Proposal. Shares of USS common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a USS stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of USS common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting, and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Compensation Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
PROPOSAL 3: THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL
We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting (the Adjournment Proposal). If USS stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from USS stockholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against the Merger Agreement Proposal. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Agreement Proposal such that the Merger Agreement Proposal would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of the Merger Agreement Proposal. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of USS common stock representing a majority of the voting power present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, and entitled to vote on the Adjournment Proposal is required for approval of the Adjournment Proposal.
For purposes of the Adjournment Proposal, (a) a failure to be represented by proxy or attend the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal other than reducing the number of affirmative votes required to achieve a majority for such matter by reducing the total number of shares of USS common stock from which the majority is calculated, (b) whether or not a quorum is present, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Adjournment Proposal and (c) whether or not a quorum is present, “broker non-votes” (if any) will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. Shares of USS common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If a USS stockholder returns a signed proxy card without indicating voting preferences on such proxy card, the shares of USS common stock represented by that proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Special Meeting, and all of such shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
If the Merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of USS stockholders. However, if the Merger is not completed, USS stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.
USS stockholders will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2024, which we refer to as the “USS 2024 annual meeting,” only if the Merger has not already been completed.
As described in our proxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, filed on March 10, 2023, USS stockholders may submit proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement for the USS 2024 annual meeting and for consideration at the USS 2024 annual meeting by submitting their proposals in writing to the Corporate Secretary of USS in a timely manner. In order to be considered for inclusion in USS’s proxy materials for the USS 2024 annual meeting, stockholder proposals must have been received by the Corporate Secretary of USS no later than November 10, 2023 and must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.
Under our by-laws, a stockholder (or a group of stockholders) that has maintained continuous qualifying ownership of at least 3% of USS’s outstanding common stock for at least three years, may nominate and include in our proxy materials for the USS 2024 annual meeting, nominees for our Board of Directors, subject to satisfying the requirements and conditions in our by-laws. The total number of director nominees appearing in our proxy materials for the USS 2024 annual meeting, together with directors nominated by stockholders at either of the preceding two annual meetings and who are re-nominated for election at the USS 2024 annual meeting, shall not exceed 20% of the number of directors serving on the Board of Directors of USS as of November 10, 2023 or if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below 20%. To utilize such “proxy access” nomination process, among other things, the electing stockholder(s) and proposed nominee(s) must comply with the detailed requirements set forth in our by-laws, including the provision of the proposing stockholder information, various other required information, representations, undertakings, agreements and other requirements as set forth in our by-laws and as required by law. One such requirement is that the nomination(s) must be received in a timely manner between 120 days and 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the date our proxy statement was first sent to stockholders in connection with the last annual meeting, which for our proxy materials for the USS 2024 annual meeting would have been no earlier than October 12, 2023 and no later than November 10, 2023.
Our by-laws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to business to be brought before an annual meeting, including stockholder proposals not included in USS’s proxy statement for such annual meeting. Except as provided in the paragraph above, for director nominations or other business to be properly brought before the USS 2024 annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder proposal must be received by the Corporate Secretary of USS no later than January 26, 2024 and no earlier than December 27, 2023. If the date of the USS 2024 annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days after the anniversary of the USS 2023 annual meeting, a stockholder’s notice of a proposal will be timely if it is received by USS by the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to the USS 2024 annual meeting and (ii) the 10th day following the day USS first publicly announces the date of the USS 2024 annual meeting.
The description of certain provisions of our by-laws above is intended as a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the relevant by-law provisions regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals and nominating director candidates. A copy of the full text of the by-law provisions governing the notice requirements set forth above may be obtained by writing to USS’s Corporate Secretary at 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219 or by calling (412) 433-4804. All notices of proposals and director nominations by USS stockholders should be sent to United States Steel Corporation, 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

Section 3.1 Effect on Capital Stock.
(a)	At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:
(i)	Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, the “Common Stock,” and each, a “Share”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $55.00 per Share in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 3.1(a) shall be automatically cancelled upon the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares (“Certificates”) or noncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 3.2.
(ii)	Cancellation of Shares. Each Share that is owned by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company as treasury stock or otherwise, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any shares of Common Stock held by any Company Employee Plan or trust related thereto (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under any of the Company Equity Plans), or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cancelled Shares”) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
(iii)	Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(b)	Dissenters’ Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal of such Shares, as applicable (the “Dissenting Shares”), pursuant to, and who have properly exercised and perfected their demands for appraisal rights under and
comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Appraisal Rights”) shall not be converted into the

right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being understood and acknowledged that such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the Appraisal Rights); provided, that if any such holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a). “Proposed Dissenting Shares” means shares of Common Stock whose holders provide demands for appraisal to the Company prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting and do not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the Appraisal Rights. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the Appraisal Rights and as provided in the first sentence of this Section 3.1(b). The Company shall give Parent (i) notice and copies of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares and (ii) the reasonable opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.
(c)	Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided, that nothing in this Section 3.1(c) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement (including Section 6.1).
Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.
(a)	Paying Agent. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance by the Company in writing (the “Paying Agent”), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares), payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article 3 (such cash being referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a), Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the shortfall that is required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make delivery of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement.
(b)	Payment Procedures.
(i)	As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares represented by Certificates whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually reasonably agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
(ii)	Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with

the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holder’s properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and (y) the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time, and (ii) to the extent required by the Paying Agent, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to issue and deliver to each holder of Book-Entry Shares a check or wire transfer for an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares that are represented by such holder’s Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration, in each case, without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or cancellation of Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of a Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent in proper form for transfer, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
(iii)	The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates or agents), as applicable, and any other applicable withholding agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or under any provision of applicable U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity within the time and in the manner required by applicable Law, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any compensatory amounts payable to any current or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be remitted to the applicable payor for payment to the applicable Person through regular payroll procedures, as applicable, or, at the election of the Company, through a payroll agent, in either case subject to any required deductions or withholdings.
(c)	Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such Certificates shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 3.2(b) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article 3.
(d)	Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that, as of the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares shall thereafter be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.
(e)	Abandoned Property; No Liability. Any portion of the Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the former holders of Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f)	Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund solely as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. Government; provided, further, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article 3, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 3.2(d).

(a)	Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or any other Person, each Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company RSU Award (or portion thereof).
(b)	Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or any other Person, each Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company PSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends corresponding to such vested Company PSU Award (or portion thereof). For purposes of clause .(li). of the immediately preceding sentence, the total number of Shares subject to a Company PSU Award shall be based on deemed achievement of the greater of (1) maximum performance, to the extent such treatment is required by the applicable award agreement as of the date hereof, (2) actual performance or (3) target performance through the Effective Time; it being understood that if any portion of the Company PSU Award has been earned by its terms as of the Effective Time, but has not yet become vested, the total number of Shares subject to such Company PSU Award shall be based on the number of Shares actually earned.
(c)	Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or any other Person, each Company Option Award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not vested, automatically become fully vested and shall be cancelled, and converted into the right of the holder of each such Company Option Award to receive (subject to any applicable withholdings) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Company Option Award, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Option Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming full vesting for any Company Option Award (or portion thereof) that is subject to performance-based vesting). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise price of any Company Option Award (whether vested or unvested) is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option Award shall be cancelled without any consideration being payable in respect thereof and shall have no further force or effect.

(b)	As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt Commitment Letters are in full force and effect, (ii) the Debt Commitments Letters have not been restated, modified, amended or supplemented in any respect or waived and no such restatement, modification, amendment, supplement or waiver is contemplated (other than as permitted by Section 6.17(b)), and (iii) the respective obligations and commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, reduced, rescinded, amended, restated, otherwise modified or repudiated in any respect or terminated.

As of the date hereof, assuming conditions set forth in Article 7 will be satisfied, neither Guarantor, Parent nor Merger Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis, and in any event, not later than the Closing, any term or condition to the Debt Commitment Letters required to be satisfied by it or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters will not be available at the Closing if the terms or conditions to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letters are satisfied. Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing, in each case, to be paid by it on or before the date of this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of “flex” (including any original issue discount flex) provided for under the Debt Commitment Letters) when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters, together with cash on hand of Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, will be sufficient to (i) fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent or Merger Sub for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) perform all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s payment obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Merger Consideration, all amounts in respect of the repayment, redemption and/or refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries required in connection with the Contemplated Transactions or the Debt Commitment Letter and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.18(d) and (iii) fund the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Merger (including any fees (including original issue discount), premiums and expenses related to the Contemplated Transactions, including the Debt Financing) (collectively, the “Funding Obligations” and such sufficient proceeds, the “Funds”). There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full net proceeds (or any portion) of the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof, except as permitted by Section 6.17(b). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that their respective obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon obtaining the Funds to satisfy the Funding Obligations.
Section 5.12 Solvency. Parent is not entering into this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of itself or any of its Affiliates. Assuming (a) the satisfaction or waiver of the condition to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.3(c) and (b) the representations of the Company set forth in Article 4 are true and correct, immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, Parent and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent.

other materials prepared by or for the Company Board, whether in connection with a specific meeting, or otherwise relating to such subject matter). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make any disclosure pursuant to this Section 6.3 to the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties or reasonably likely to become adverse parties, and any such access will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measurements and insurance requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3(a), any document, correspondence or information or other access provided pursuant to this Section 6.3(a) may be redacted or otherwise limited to prevent disclosure of information concerning the valuation of the Company and the Merger or other confidential or competitively sensitive information. To the extent that the Company reasonably determines doing so may be required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws or Foreign Investment Laws, information disclosed pursuant to this Section 6.3 may be disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, provided, that such disclosure would reasonably permit the disclosure of information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing applicable legal privilege. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may satisfy its obligations set forth above to provide access to employees, officers, properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and any other documents and information by electronic means if physical access is not reasonably feasible or would not be permitted under applicable Law (including any COVID-19 Measures). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3(a), in no event shall the work papers of the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ independent accountants and auditors be accessible to Parent or any of its Representatives unless and until such accountants and auditors have provided a consent related thereto in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or independent accountants; provided, that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent or any of its Representatives in obtaining such consent at the request of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Representatives shall not be permitted to perform any intrusive environmental study or assessment with respect to any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company.
(b)	Parent agrees that all information provided to it or any of its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall be deemed to be Confidential Information and/or Transaction Information, as applicable, as such terms are used in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the confidentiality agreement, dated as of August 29, 2023, between the Company and Parent, as supplemented by the Clean Team Agreement by and between the Company and Parent, dated as of October 11, 2023 (together, the “Confidentiality Agreement”), which, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth therein, shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing Date. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
Section 6.4 No Solicitation.
(a)	Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.4, from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, induce, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the making or submission of, any proposal, offer, inquiry or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, any Alternative Proposal or (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions regarding any proposal, offer, inquiry or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, an Alternative Proposal or furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or provide access to their respective operational properties to any Person (other than Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) relating to any proposal, offer, inquiry or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, an Alternative Proposal (except, in each case, to (x) notify such Person that the provisions of this Section 6.4 prohibit any such discussions or negotiations or (y) ascertain facts from the Person making (or considering making) such Alternative Proposal solely for the purpose of informing itself about such Alternative Proposal and the Person making (or considering making) such Alternative Proposal to determine whether or not such Alternative Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal).

(b)	The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately following execution of this Agreement cease and cause to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) in connection with any Alternative Proposal submitted as of, or on or prior to, the date of this Agreement, (ii) terminate access to the Dataroom (or any other physical or electronic data room maintained by the Company relating to the Company’s exploration of strategic alternatives) by any Person (other than (x) Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives and (y) the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives) and (iii) promptly following execution of this Agreement request that each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the nine (9)-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Alternative Proposal (other than Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) return or destroy all confidential information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Person (it being understood that compliance with the express requirements of this Section 6.4(b) shall not in and of itself be deemed a breach of Section 6.4(a)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company (A) shall not modify, amend or terminate, or waive, release, or assign any standstill provisions or similar agreements with any Person and (B) shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreements; provided, that the Company may waive any standstill or similar agreement solely to the extent necessary to allow for an Alternative Proposal to be made to the Company Board in a confidential manner so long as the Company promptly notifies Parent thereof (including the identity of such counterparty) concurrently with granting any such waiver. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 6.4 by any of the Company’s Subsidiaries, or any of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ respective Representatives, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.4 by the Company.
(c)	From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt) notify Parent (orally and in writing) of the receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives of any proposal, offer, inquiry or request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, an Alternative Proposal, which notice shall include a summary of the material terms and conditions of (and the identity of the Person making) such proposal, offer, inquiry or request and shall include with such notice copies of such proposal, offer, inquiry or request and copies of any other documents, in each case, evidencing or specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or request, in each case, to the extent provided in writing and (ii) thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt (and, in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) basis of any material developments with respect to, or any material change to the terms of, any such Alternative Proposal, including by providing copies of any additional draft agreements relating to, or written proposals containing any material term of, any such Alternative Proposal received by the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives.
(d)	Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, if, at any time following the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal, which Alternative Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.4, and the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors that (x) such Alternative Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may take the following actions: (i) furnish information, including material non-public information, to any Person making such Alternative Proposal, as well as its Representatives and potential financing sources, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the third party has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company having provisions as to confidential treatment of information that are not materially less favorable in any substantive respect to the Company than the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that (A) any confidentiality agreement need not contain any “standstill,” employee nonsolicitation or similar provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Alternative Proposal and (B) any confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit the Company from satisfying its obligations hereunder) (provided, that the Company shall, prior to or concurrently with such disclosure, make available to Parent any non-public information that is made available to such Person to the extent not previously provided to

Parent or its Representatives), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person (as well as its Representatives) with respect to the Alternative Proposal. It is understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or negotiations expressly permitted under this Section 6.4(d), including any public announcement (solely to the extent required by applicable Law) that the Company or the Company Board has made any determination contemplated under this Section 6.4(d) to take or engage in any such actions, shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Change of Recommendation or constitute a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g)(ii).
(e)	Except as set forth in this Section 6.4, the Company Board shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in any manner adverse to Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in any manner adverse to Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iv) fail to publish, send or provide to the holders of Shares, pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act a statement recommending against any Alternative Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer and publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender offer or exchange offer or fail to maintain such recommendation against such offer at any time before such offer has expired or been withdrawn, (v) if an Alternative Proposal (other than an Alternative Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer) shall have been publicly announced or disclosed, fail to recommend against such Alternative Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Recommendation on or prior to the earlier of ten (10) Business Days after such Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed two (2) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or (vi) resolve to effect or publicly announce an intention to effect any of the foregoing (any such action described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi), a “Change of Recommendation”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may, in response to an Alternative Proposal received by the Company after the date of this Agreement that has not been subsequently withdrawn, which Alternative Proposal did not result from a material breach of this Section 6.4, and with respect to which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (1) such Alternative Proposal would if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) make a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g)(i); provided, that the Company Board shall not be entitled to make such a Change of Recommendation or cause such termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) (i) unless, in each case, (A) the Company shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days’ written notice (a “Superior Proposal Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, which Superior Proposal Notice shall include a description of the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and the other information specified in Section 6.4(c), (B) during such five (5)-Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent so desires to negotiate) to consider amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner so that such Alternative Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (C) at the end of such five (5)-Business Day period, after taking into account any irrevocable commitments or binding proposals made by Parent to the Company in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement during such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel that (I) the Alternative Proposal giving rise to the Superior Proposal Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (II) the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that in the event of any material modification of the financial terms or any other material modifications to the terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with the requirements of this Section 6.4(e) with respect to such new written notice, except that the notice period under clause (A) shall be three (3) Business Days. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of a Superior Proposal Notice, in and of itself, will not constitute a Change of Recommendation or violate this Section 6.4.

(f)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event that is continuing, make a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make a Change of Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the Company Board shall not be entitled to make such a Change of Recommendation unless (i) the Company shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days’ written notice (an “Intervening Event Notice”) advising Parent of its intention to make such a Change of Recommendation, which Intervening Event Notice shall include a description of the applicable Intervening Event, (ii) to the extent requested by Parent during such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent so desires to negotiate) to consider amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that would permit the Company Board, consistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties, not to make such Change of Recommendation and (iii) at the end of such five (5)-Business Day period, after taking into account any irrevocable commitments or binding proposals made by Parent to the Company in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement during such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood that any such determination in and of itself shall not be deemed a Change of Recommendation). For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of an Intervening Event Notice, in and of itself, will not constitute a Change of Recommendation or violate this Section 6.4.
(g)	Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law or NYSE or CSE rules and regulations, including taking or disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder (and no communication that consists solely of a “stop, look and listen” statement, in and of itself, will be considered a Change of Recommendation) or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, that such disclosure is required by applicable Law; provided that no disclosure or communication will be permitted pursuant to the foregoing sentence that constitutes a Change of Recommendation or shall require the giving of a Superior Proposal Notice or an Intervening Event Notice except in accordance with Section 6.4(e) or Section 6.4(f). It is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a public statement by the Company or the Company Board that describes the receipt of an Alternative Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Alternative Proposal, the material terms of such Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto (that does not otherwise indicate or suggest that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal) will not be deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal, modification or proposal by the Company Board to withhold, withdraw, or modify, the Recommendation; (B) an approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability with respect to such Alternative Proposal; or (C) a Change of Recommendation.
(h)	“Alternative Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer made by any Person (other than Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates) relating to or concerning (i) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of (including through the acquisition of any equity interests of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company comprising) (A) twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or (B) assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries to which twenty percent (20%) or more of the revenues or earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are attributable for the most recent fiscal year for which the audited financial statements are then available (other than, in each case, sales of inventory, leases and nonexclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business) or (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person (including by way of merger, reorganization, division, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction), or a tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning, twenty percent (20%) or more of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent company thereof), as applicable, immediately following such transaction, in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), whether in a single or series of related transactions.

The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the record date of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, prior to setting such date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) the Company may adjourn, recess, or postpone, and at the request of Parent it shall adjourn, recess or postpone, the Company Stockholders’ Meeting for a reasonable period to solicit additional proxies, if the Company or Parent, respectively, reasonably believes there will be insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting or to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Vote (provided, that, unless agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, all such adjournments, recesses or postponements shall be for periods of no more than ten (10) Business Days each (not to exceed twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate without Parent’s written consent)) and (y) the Company may adjourn, recess, or postpone the Company Stockholders’ Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.

Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company Employee whose employment terminates during the one (1)-year period following the Effective Time severance benefits equal to the severance benefits that would have been provided to the Company Employee under the Company’s severance arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and set forth on Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation and employee benefits for Company Employees covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be provided in accordance with the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as in effect from time to time and shall not be covered by this Section 6.6. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be prohibited by this Section 6.6(a) from terminating the employment of or changing or modifying the terms and conditions of employment for any Company Employee following the Closing Date.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Company Employees participate in the New Plans, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
(c)	Parent acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Employee Plans will occur at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication covered by this Section 6.6(d), and Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on each such communication (such review and comments not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(f)	Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) give prompt notice to Parent of any meetings, substantive communications, discussions or negotiations between the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives and the USW or any other Union or their respective Representatives, relating to this Agreement, the Right-to-Bid Provision, the Successorship Provision or the Contemplated Transactions and (ii) provide a written description with respect to any matters for which notice is required under Section 6.6(f)(i).
(g)	Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, the provisions of this Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or former officer, director, employee or other individual service provider or any other person shall be (i) conferred any rights or remedies under any Company Employee Plan or any New Plan or other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangements, including any right to employment or continued employment for any period or terms of employment; or (ii) a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or directors or officers of an Acquired Company to the extent serving as fiduciaries with respect to any Company Employee Plan), in each case, at or prior to the Effective Time (each, together with such Person’s heirs, executors or administrators, and successors and assigns, an “Indemnified Party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law following receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced amounts if it is ultimately determined by final and non-appealable adjudication that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.10(b)), liabilities and losses, reasonably incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an “Action”), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with any such Indemnified Party serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.
(c)	For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers or provide substitute policies for the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured Persons than the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (regardless of when such claims are brought) (with insurance carriers having the same or better A.M. Best financial rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance carriers), except that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the “Maximum Amount”). If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.10(c) because its cost exceeds the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six (6)-year period for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option, purchase, or Parent may, at its option request that the Company purchase, a six (6)-year prepaid “tail” directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such tail policy to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured Persons than the directors’ and officers’ and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that the Company shall not pay an aggregate amount for such policy in excess of the Maximum Amount. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and effect and to continue to honor the obligations thereunder.
(d)	Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.10 (subject to the undertakings described in Section 6.10(b)).
(e)	The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

then, in each case, Parent shall pay the Parent Termination Fee to the Company as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days following the date of the Company Election, which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, occur after the date of termination) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company. Promptly following a termination described in Section 8.3(b)(i) or (ii), the Company shall irrevocably elect in writing to accept or decline the Parent Termination Fee (the “Company Election”). If the Company has declined the Parent Termination Fee, the Company Election shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of the Parent Termination Fee. In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Upon the payment by Parent of the Parent Termination Fee as and when required by this Section 8.3(b) and subject to the Company’s election to accept Parent Termination Fee specified in the Company Election, together with any fees, costs, expenses and interest payable pursuant to Section 8.3(c), none of the Parent Related Parties or any Debt Financing Source shall have any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions to the Company Related Parties or any other Person, except to the extent provided in Section 8.2 and except in the case of a Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud by Parent (in which case the Company shall be entitled to seek monetary damages, recovery or award from Parent; provided, that, in no event will the Company Related Parties or any other Person be entitled to seek monetary damages, recovery or award for Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud arising out of any matter forming the basis for such termination if the Company has elected to accept the Parent Termination Fee in the Company Election). If the Company has elected to accept the Parent Termination Fee in the Company Election, payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Acquired Companies, any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Contemplated Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and, upon the Company’s election to accept the Parent Termination Fee in the Company Election, none of the Company Related Parties or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Action or Legal Proceeding against any of the Parent Related Parties or any Debt Financing Source arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Contemplated Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination, except, in each case, to the extent provided in Section 8.2 and except in the case of a Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud by Parent or Merger Sub (in which case the Company shall be entitled to seek monetary damages, recovery or award from Parent or Merger Sub); provided, that, in no event will the Company Related Parties or any other Person be entitled to seek monetary damages, recovery or award for Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud arising out of any matter forming the basis for such termination if the Company has elected to accept the Parent Termination Fee in the Company Election. The Company’s right to receive payment from Parent of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) against any of the Parent Related Parties or any Debt Financing Source for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, none of the Parent Related Parties or any Debt Financing Source shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, except, in each case, to the extent provided in Section 8.2 and except in the case of a Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud by Parent or Merger Sub (in which case the Company shall be entitled to seek monetary damages, recovery or award from Parent or Merger Sub); provided, that, in no event will any of the Parent Related Parties be liable for monetary damages, recovery or award for Willful Breach of this Agreement or Fraud arising out of any matter forming the basis for such termination if the Company has elected to accept the Parent Termination Fee in the Company Election.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(c)	Acknowledgements. Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without Section 8.3(a), Parent would not have entered into this Agreement and that, without Section 8.3(b), the Company would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Company, or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent (or its designee(s)) or the Company, respectively, all fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including attorneys’ fees as well as expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated by such Party), together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to be made plus two percent (2%) per annum. The Parties further acknowledge that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but is each liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate such Party in the circumstances in which either the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable (and, with respect to the Parent Termination Fee, the Company has elected to accept the Parent Termination Fee in the Company Election) for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
ARTICLE 9 MISCELLANEOUS
Section 9.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties and, subject to the following sentence, covenants and agreements, in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This Section 9.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.
Section 9.2 Expenses. Except as set forth in Section 8.3 and subject to the following sentence, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the other Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring or required to incur such expenses, except that expenses incurred by any Party in connection with the printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC filing fees) shall be borne equally by the Company and Parent, and all filing fees paid by any Party in respect of any HSR Act or other regulatory filing shall be borne by Parent. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2(b), all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes (for the avoidance of doubt, not including income, capital gain, gross receipt and other similar Taxes) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Merger (including such Taxes that are also imposed on any holder of Shares with respect to the transfer of Shares as joint and several liability) shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.
Section 9.3 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including by electronic mail in “portable document format” (.pdf) form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered (by telecopy, electronic mail or otherwise as authorized by the prior sentence) to the other Parties. No Party may raise the use of any such electronic delivery or electronic signature as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
Section 9.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Contemplated Transactions (whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise), each of the Parties: (i) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware (unless the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, in which case the United States District Court for the District of Delaware); (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court; and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any such action in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, Delaware (unless the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, in which case the United States District Court for the District of Delaware). Service of any process, summons, notice or document to any Party’s address and in the manner set forth in Section 9.6 shall be effective service of process for any such action.
(b)	EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER BODY OF LAW, TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES, AGREES AND CERTIFIES THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO PREVENT OR DELAY ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.4.
Section 9.5 Specific Enforcement. Except as otherwise provided herein (including the final sentence of Section 9.5), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate the Contemplated Transactions). Each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each Party agrees that the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief. The pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable remedy by any Party will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in equity) to which such Party may be entitled at any time, subject to the limitations or remedies set forth in this Agreement. In circumstances where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that the Company and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate the Company and its stockholders, and that the Company on behalf of itself and its stockholders shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to enforce specifically Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objection to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance in accordance with and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement or to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement on the basis that there is adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining

any remedy referred to in this Section 9.5, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The Parties acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence and that the Parties would suffer ongoing irreparable injury for so long as any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms, including as a result of any dispute over the Parties’ obligations to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. It is accordingly agreed that, as to any Actions or Legal Proceedings in which a Party seeks specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this Section 9.5, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to seek and obtain an expedited schedule for such proceedings and shall not oppose any Party’s request for expedited proceedings. Each Party further agrees that by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.5, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement, and nothing set forth in this Section 9.5 shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party’s rights to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 9.5 prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article 8, nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.5 or anything set forth in this Section 9.5 restrict or limit any Party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article 8 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise in connection with the Debt Financing that might be available then or thereafter (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and therein). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent expressly permitted by this Section 9.5 and the payment of, subject to Section 8.2 and Section 8.3, other monetary damages, under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to both specifically perform the terms of this Agreement and pay other monetary damages.

Section 9.7 Assignment; Binding Effect.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) without limitation to the foregoing, subject to Section 8.3(b) and Section 9.5, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that the Company shall have the right, on behalf of its stockholders, to pursue damages against Parent and/or Merger Sub for the loss of the Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damages based on the loss of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to each such holder) in the event of any Fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub in respect of which the Company is entitled to bring a claim hereunder and (y) Section 9.4, Section 9.7, Section 9.8, this Section 9.9, Section 9.10 and Section 9.14 are intended for the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources and the Debt Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 9.10 Amendments; Waivers. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, that after receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE or the CSE require further approval of the stockholders of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, as applicable, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, as applicable. The foregoing notwithstanding, no failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.
Section 9.11 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Section 9.12 Obligations of Merger Sub. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Merger Sub to take such action.
Section 9.13 Guaranty.
(a)	To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as principal and not as surety, to the Company, the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns the due and punctual payment and performance of each of the covenants, obligations and Liabilities of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable (the “Guaranteed Obligations”). This guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual discharge and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations. This guaranty is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection. Any breach or nonperformance of any such obligations of Merger Sub or Parent (or any of their successors or assigns) shall also be deemed to be a default of Guarantor. So long as this Section 9.13 is in effect, Guarantor shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of its performance of its guaranty, whether by subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, contribution or otherwise, against the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their successors and assigns or any express intended third party beneficiary described in Section 9.9 of any Guaranteed Obligations, or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor.
(b)	If and whenever Parent or Merger Sub defaults for any reason whatsoever in the performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Guarantor shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following demand, unconditionally perform (or procure the performance of) and satisfy (or procure the satisfaction of) the Guaranteed Obligations in regard to which such default has been made in the manner prescribed by this Agreement and so that the same benefits are conferred on the Company, the Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns as such Person would have received if the Guaranteed Obligations had been duly performed and satisfied by Parent and Merger Sub.
(c)	Guarantor represents and warrants to the Company as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier date or period, in which case as of such date or period) as follows.
(i)	Guarantor is a legal Entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization.
(ii)	Guarantor has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Section 9.13 and to perform its obligations under this Section 9.13. The execution, delivery and performance of this Section 9.13 by the Guarantor, have been duly and validly authorized by the boards of directors of the Guarantor, and this Section 9.13 has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Guarantor and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, this

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 9.13 constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.
(d)	Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Section 9.13, neither Guarantor nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Guarantor or any of its Affiliates (other than the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Article 5). Guarantor’s obligations under this Section 9.13 are expressly limited to Guaranteed Obligations and shall automatically expire upon the full discharge and performance of all Guaranteed Obligations and thereafter, Guarantor shall no longer have any duties or obligations under this Agreement.
(e)	This guaranty is to be a continuing guaranty and accordingly is to remain in force until all the Guaranteed Obligations have been performed or satisfied. This guaranty is in addition to and without prejudice to and not in substitution for any rights that the Company, the Surviving Corporation, their successors and assigns and any third-party beneficiary may now or in future have or hold for the performance and observance of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed Obligations shall be discharged as a result of (i) indefeasible payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) those defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that Parent or Merger Sub has (A) arising from Fraud or Willful Breach by the Company or (B) under the specific terms of this Agreement.

Board of Directors
United States Steel Corporation 600 Grant Street, 61st Floor Pittsburgh, PA 15219
Members of the Board of Directors:
We understand that United States Steel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), intends to enter into a transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”) with Nippon Steel North America, Inc., a New York corporation (“Parent”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel Corporation, a Japanese corporation (“Nippon”), 2023 Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and Nippon, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”) with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and (ii) each share of common stock, par value $ 1.00 per share (the “Shares”), of the Company, outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger other than Shares that are Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Agreement (as defined below)) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $55.00 per Share (the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction are set forth in more detail in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 18, 2023 (the “Agreement”), among the Company, Merger Sub, Nippon, solely as provided in Section 9.13 of the Agreement, and Parent. The summary of the Proposed Transaction set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Agreement.
We have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render our opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Shares of the Merger Consideration to be offered to such holders in the Proposed Transaction. We have not been requested to opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the Company’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of consummation of the Proposed Transaction. In addition, we express no opinion on, and our opinion does not in any manner address the fairness of the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be offered to the holders of Shares in the Proposed Transaction or otherwise. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Proposed Transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage.
In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) the Agreement and the specific terms of the Proposed Transaction; (2) publicly available information concerning the Company that we believe to be relevant to our analysis, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023; (3) financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of the Company furnished to us by the Company, including financial projections of the Company prepared by the management of the Company (the “Company Projections”); (4) a trading history of Shares from December 15, 2021 to December 15, 2023 and a comparison of that trading history with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (5) a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of the Company with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (6) a comparison of the financial terms of the Proposed Transaction with the financial terms of certain other recent transactions that we deemed relevant; (7) published estimates of independent research analysts with respect to the future financial performance and price targets of the Company; and (8) the results of our efforts to solicit indications of interest from third parties with respect to a sale of all or a part of the Company. In addition, we have had discussions with the management of the Company concerning its business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects, and have undertaken such other studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by us without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed responsibility or liability for any independent verification of such information) and have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the Company Projections, upon the advice of the Company, we have assumed that such projections have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. We assume no responsibility for and we express no view as to any such projections or estimates or the assumptions on which they are based. In arriving at our opinion, we have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company and have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company. Our opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic and other conditions as they exist on, and can be evaluated as of, the date of this letter. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on events or circumstances that may occur after the date of this letter.
We have assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and all agreements related thereto. We have also assumed, upon the advice of the Company, that all material governmental, regulatory and third-party approvals, consents and releases for the Proposed Transaction will be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the Agreement and that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the Proposed Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we understand that the Company has obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the date hereof that the Merger Consideration to be offered to the holders of Shares in the Proposed Transaction is fair to such holders from a financial point of view.
We are acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Proposed Transaction and will receive fees for our services, a portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse a portion of our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities that may arise out of our engagement and the rendering of this opinion. We have performed various investment banking services for the Company in the past, and expect to perform such services in the future, and have received, and expect to receive, customary fees for such services. Specifically, in the past two years, we have performed the following investment banking and financial services for the Company: (i) in August 2022, acted as a co-manager on the Company’s offering of $290 million of muni bonds, (ii) in May 2023, acted as a co-manager on the Company’s offering of $240 million of muni bonds, (iii) acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with certain potential divestiture transactions, and (iv) participated as a lender under the Company’s existing credit facilities. We have not received investment banking fees from Nippon or any of its subsidiaries in the past two years.
Barclays Capital Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial banking, lending, asset management and other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade and effect transactions in the equity, debt and/or other securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments (including loans and other obligations) of the Company, Parent and Nippon for our own account and for the accounts of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions and investments in such securities and financial instruments.
This opinion, the issuance of which has been approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee, is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company and is rendered to the Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the Proposed Transaction.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Nippon Steel Corporation (“Nippon”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the “Shares”), of United States Steel Corporation (the “Company”) of the $55.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 18, 2023 (the “Agreement”), by and among Nippon Steel North America, Inc. (“Parent”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon, 2023 Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, solely as provided in Section 9.13 of the Agreement, Nippon, and the Company.
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting, lending, and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Nippon, Parent, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, the principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as co-manager with respect to the issuance of unsecured bonds of the Company in May 2023; as comanager with respect to the issuance of unsecured bonds of the Company in September 2022; and as comanager with respect to the tender offer to purchase senior notes of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in September 2022. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Nippon, Parent and their respective affiliates for which Goldman Sachs Investment Banking may receive compensation.
In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five years ended December 31, 2022; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by the Company (the “Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared certain financial and stock market information

for the Company with similar information for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the steel industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.
For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation, appraisal or geological or technical assessment of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balancesheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.
Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Nippon and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $55.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $55.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Nippon and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the prices at which the Shares will trade at any time or as to the potential effects of volatility in the credit, financial and stock markets on the Company or the Transaction, or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or the ability of the Company to pay its obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $55.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Nippon and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

(1)	If a proposed merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations or the converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation, and shall include in such notice either a copy of this section (and, if 1 of the constituent corporations or the converting corporation is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title) or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which this section (and, § 114 of this title, if applicable) may be accessed without subscription or cost. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the surviving, resulting or converted entity shall notify each stockholder of each constituent or converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, and any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, of the date that the merger, consolidation or conversion has become effective; or
(2)	If the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation before the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, or the surviving, resulting or converted entity within 10 days after such effective date, shall notify each stockholder of any class or series of stock of such constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation who is entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer,

domestication or continuance and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation, and shall include in such notice either a copy of this section (and, if 1 of the constituent corporations or the converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title) or information directing the stockholders to a publicly available electronic resource at which this section (and § 114 of this title, if applicable) may be accessed without subscription or cost. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving, resulting or converted entity the appraisal of such holder’s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to such entity by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs such entity of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, either (i) each such constituent corporation or the converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance or (ii) the surviving, resulting or converted entity shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection and any beneficial owner who has demanded appraisal under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation or entity that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation or the converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.
(3)	Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section (but subject to this paragraph (d)(3)), a beneficial owner may, in such person’s name, demand in writing an appraisal of such beneficial owner’s shares in accordance with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable; provided that (i) such beneficial owner continuously owns such shares through the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance and otherwise satisfies the requirements applicable to a stockholder under the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section and (ii) the demand made by such beneficial owner reasonably identifies the holder of record of the shares for which the demand is made, is accompanied by documentary evidence of such beneficial owner’s beneficial ownership of stock and a statement that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it purports to be, and provides an address at which such beneficial owner consents to receive notices given by the surviving, resulting or converted entity hereunder and to be set forth on the verified list required by subsection (f) of this section.
(e)	Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, the surviving, resulting or converted entity, or any person who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an

appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, any person entitled to appraisal rights who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, any person who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the surviving, resulting or converted entity a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in § 251 (h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in § 251(h)(2) of this title)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of stockholders or beneficial owners holding or owning such shares (provided that, where a beneficial owner makes a demand pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the record holder of such shares shall not be considered a separate stockholder holding such shares for purposes of such aggregate number). Such statement shall be given to the person within 10 days after such person’s request for such a statement is received by the surviving, resulting or converted entity or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section, whichever is later.
(f)	Upon the filing of any such petition by any person other than the surviving, resulting or converted entity, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon such entity, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all persons who have demanded appraisal for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by such entity. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving, resulting or converted entity, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving, resulting or converted entity and to the persons shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving, resulting or converted entity.
(g)	At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the persons who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the persons who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any person fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such person. If immediately before the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent, converting, transferring, domesticating or continuing corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.
(h)	After the Court determines the persons entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer,

domestication or continuance through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger, consolidation or conversion and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving, resulting or converted entity may pay to each person entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving, resulting or converted entity or by any person entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the persons entitled to an appraisal. Any person whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving, resulting or converted entity pursuant to subsection (f) of this section may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such person is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.
(i)	The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving, resulting or converted entity to the persons entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such person upon such terms and conditions as the Court may order. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving, resulting or converted entity be an entity of this State or of any state.
(j)	The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a person whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving, resulting or converted entity pursuant to subsection (f) of this section who participated in the proceeding and incurred expenses in connection therewith, the Court may order all or a portion of such expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection (k) of this section or subject to such an award pursuant to a reservation of jurisdiction under subsection (k) of this section.
(k)	Subject to the remainder of this subsection, from and after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, no person who has demanded appraisal rights with respect to some or all of such person’s shares as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance). If a person who has made a demand for an appraisal in accordance with this section shall deliver to the surviving, resulting or converted entity a written withdrawal of such person’s demand for an appraisal in respect of some or all of such person’s shares in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, either within 60 days after such effective date or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such person to an appraisal of the shares subject to the withdrawal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall not be dismissed as to any person without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just, including without limitation, a reservation of jurisdiction for any application to the Court made under subsection (j) of this section; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any person who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such person’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, conversion, transfer, domestication or continuance, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section. If a petition for an appraisal is not filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, the right to appraisal with respect to all shares shall cease.
(l)	The shares or other equity interests of the surviving, resulting or converted entity to which the shares of stock subject to appraisal under this section would have otherwise converted but for an appraisal demand made in accordance with this section shall have the status of authorized but not outstanding shares of stock or other equity interests of the surviving, resulting or converted entity, unless and until the person that has demanded appraisal is no longer entitled to appraisal pursuant to this section.
