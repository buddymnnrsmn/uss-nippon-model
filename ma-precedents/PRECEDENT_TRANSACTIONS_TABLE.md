## USS Intrinsic Value Reconciliation

### Precedent Multiple Analysis

**Methodology:** Apply precedent EV/EBITDA multiples to USS normalized EBITDA

| USS EBITDA Scenario | 5.6x (AK Steel) | 6.0x (ArcelorMittal) | Average (5.8x) |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **$1,500M (Bear)** | EV: $8.4B / Share: $21.85 | EV: $9.0B / Share: $24.07 | EV: $8.7B / Share: $22.96 |
| **$1,750M (Conservative)** | EV: $9.8B / Share: $27.04 | EV: $10.5B / Share: $29.63 | EV: $10.2B / Share: $28.33 |
| **$2,000M (Base)** | EV: $11.2B / Share: $32.22 | EV: $12.0B / Share: $35.19 | EV: $11.6B / Share: $33.70 |
| **$2,250M (Optimistic)** | EV: $12.6B / Share: $37.41 | EV: $13.5B / Share: $40.74 | EV: $13.1B / Share: $39.07 |
| **$2,500M (Bull)** | EV: $14.0B / Share: $42.59 | EV: $15.0B / Share: $46.30 | EV: $14.5B / Share: $44.44 |

**Assumptions:** Net debt = $2,500M, Shares outstanding = 270M

### Strategic Premium Scenarios

**Nippon Steel Offer: $55.00/share ($14.9B equity value)**

| EBITDA | Multiple Implied by $55 Offer | Premium vs. Base Multiple | Justification |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| $1,500M | 11.6x | +107% vs 5.6x | Extreme overpayment |
| $1,750M | 9.7x | +73% vs 5.6x | Very high premium |
| $2,000M | 8.5x | +52% vs 5.6x | High strategic premium |
| $2,250M | 7.4x | +32% vs 5.6x | Moderate strategic premium |
| **$2,500M** | **6.6x** | **+18% vs 5.6x** | **Reasonable strategic premium** |
| $2,750M | 6.0x | +7% vs 5.6x | Fair value |

**Conclusion:** Nippon's $55 offer is justified if:
- USS's normalized EBITDA is $2,500M+ (post-Big River performance)
- Strategic value (synergies, technology, investment) worth 6.6x-7.0x vs. precedent 5.6x-6.0x
- Premium of 18-32% over precedent multiples for strategic benefits

### Cleveland-Cliffs Offer Analysis

**Nominal Offer: $54.00/share ($27 cash + $27 stock)**
**Risk-Adjusted Value: $21-$31/share per USS Board analysis**

| Component | Nominal Value | Risk Adjustment | Risk-Adjusted Value |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Cash (50%)** | $27.00 | No discount | $27.00 |
| **Stock (50%)** | $27.00 | 70-85% haircut* | $4.05 - $8.10 |
| **Total per Share** | $54.00 | Combined | $31.05 - $35.10 |

*Haircut reflects:
- Massive antitrust risk (Milbank: "challenging case to win")
- 18-36 month litigation timeline
- Required $7B+ revenue divestitures depressing CLF stock
- Stock volatility over extended period

**Comparison to Precedent Multiples:**

At risk-adjusted $31.05-$35.10/share:
- Implies $8.4B-$9.5B equity value
- Implies $10.9B-$12.0B enterprise value
- At $2,000M EBITDA: **5.5x-6.0x EV/EBITDA**
- **Aligns with precedent multiples BUT massive execution risk**

## Key Insights for Valuation

### 1. Precedent Multiple Range: 5.6x - 6.0x

✅ **Established by two major deals** (AK Steel, ArcelorMittal USA)
✅ **Similar assets** (integrated steel producers, North America)
✅ **Similar timing** (2019-2020, pre-Biden industrial policy)
✅ **Both deals successful** post-close (CLF became #1 NA producer)

**Implication:** Base case USS valuation should use **5.6x-6.0x range**

### 2. Strategic Premiums Can Add 0.5x-1.5x

Nippon's 6.6x-7.0x implied multiple represents:
- **Base:** 5.6x-6.0x (precedent range)
- **Plus:** 0.6x-1.4x strategic premium for:
  - Technology transfer (Japanese advanced steelmaking)
  - Global network access
  - $11-14B investment commitments
  - Certainty of value (100% cash, no financing risk)

**Implication:** 6.6x-7.0x is **fair to premium** if strategic value realized

### 3. Normalized EBITDA is Critical

| EBITDA Level | Scenario | Evidence |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **$1,500M** | Bear case | 2019 legacy performance ($566M) + Big River (~$640M) + no improvement |
| **$2,000M** | Base case | 2017-2019 avg ($1,038M) + Big River + modest improvement |
| **$2,500M** | Optimistic | Strong cycle + Big River optimization + capex benefits |
| **$3,000M+** | Peak cycle | 2021 supercycle ($5,316M) unlikely to sustain |

**USS 2021 EBITDA of $5,316M was exceptional** (26.2% margin):
- Steel prices at all-time highs (HRC >$1,900/ton)
- Big River contributing 32% margins
- Not sustainable through cycle

**Normalized EBITDA likely $2,000M-$2,500M:**
- Big River structural improvement over legacy
- But steel prices normalized to $800-1,000/ton
- Cost pressures (energy, labor, raw materials)

### 4. Risk-Adjusted Value Matters More Than Nominal

Cleveland-Cliffs' $54 nominal = $21-31 risk-adjusted shows:
- **Stock consideration carries massive risk** in distressed M&A
- **Antitrust uncertainty destroys 40-60% of deal value**
- **Time value of money** over 24-36 months
- **Execution risk premium** must be factored

**Implication:** Nippon's cash certainty worth significant premium

---

## Recommendation Framework

### Accept Nippon's $55 Offer If:

✅ **USS's normalized EBITDA ≤ $2,250M**
- At $2,250M EBITDA × 5.8x = $13.1B EV → $39/share
- Nippon's $55 = 41% premium

✅ **Strategic value > $500M**
- Technology transfer, global network, investment commitments
- Justifies 6.6x-7.0x vs. 5.6x-6.0x precedent

✅ **Risk mitigation priority**
- Avoid Cleveland-Cliffs antitrust disaster
- Avoid standalone capex burden ($11-14B needed)
- Avoid cycle exposure (bear case $22/share)

### Reject Nippon's $55 Offer If:

❌ **USS can sustain $2,750M+ EBITDA**
- At $2,750M × 6.0x = $16.5B EV → $52/share
- At $2,750M × 7.0x = $19.3B EV → $62/share
- Standalone value exceeds offer

❌ **Better alternative available**
- Another strategic buyer willing to pay >$60/share
- Credible standalone plan to achieve $3B+ EBITDA
- Public market willing to value at 8-10x EBITDA

❌ **Belief in exceptional upside**
- 2021-style supercycle repeats ($5B+ EBITDA)
- Big River technology enables industry-leading margins
- Green steel transition creates pricing power

---

## Final Valuation Verdict

### Base Case Intrinsic Value: $33.70/share
- **EBITDA:** $2,000M (normalized post-Big River)
- **Multiple:** 5.8x (precedent average)
- **Enterprise Value:** $11.6B
- **Less Net Debt:** $2,500M
- **Equity Value:** $9.1B
- **Per Share:** $33.70 (270M shares)

### Nippon Offer Premium: +63%
- **Offer:** $55.00/share
- **Premium:** $21.30/share (63%)

### Justification for Premium:
1. **Strategic synergies:** $500M-$750M ($1.85-$2.78/share NPV)
2. **Investment commitments:** $11-14B capex USS can't fund alone
3. **Technology transfer:** Access to Japanese advanced steelmaking
4. **Certainty premium:** 100% cash vs. stock volatility
5. **Downside protection:** Floor at $55 vs. bear case $22/share

### Board Conclusion (Matches Actual Outcome):
✅ **ACCEPT** - Premium valuation with strategic upside and downside protection
✅ **98% shareholder approval** validates fairness analysis
✅ **National security agreement** preserves jobs, facilities, investments
