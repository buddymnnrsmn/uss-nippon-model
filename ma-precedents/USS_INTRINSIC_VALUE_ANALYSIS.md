---

#### Transaction 3: U.S. Steel / Big River Steel

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Target Company** | Big River Steel Holdings LLC | Private |
| **Stage 1 (49.9%)** | November 2019 - $700M | SEC 8-K |
| **Stage 2 (50.1%)** | December 2020 / January 2021 - $774M | SEC 8-K |

| **Debt/EBITDA** | 2.7x | 1.6x | 6.9x | N/M | 0.8x |

**Key Observations:**
1. **2021 Performance Exceptional:** 26.2% EBITDA margin driven by:
   - Big River Steel acquisition (closed Jan 2021) - 32% margins
   - Steel price supercycle (HRC peaked >$1,900/ton)
   - Strong automotive/construction demand recovery

2. **2020 COVID Trough:** Negative EBITDA due to pandemic demand destruction

3. **2019 Cycle Downturn:** Weak 4.4% margins reflect trade war headwinds, automotive slowdown

4. **Through-Cycle Normalization Needed:** 2017-2019 average EBITDA = $1,038M (8.5% margin)

---

### Estimating 2023 Performance (Nippon Offer Date)

**Approach:** Use industry data and USS's 2022-2023 trends (would need actual data, but can estimate)

**Assumptions for Dec 2023 Valuation:**
- 2022-2023 saw steel prices normalize from 2021 peaks
- HRC prices returned to $800-1,000/ton range (vs. $1,900 peak)
- Big River Steel continued contributing strong margins
- Legacy integrated mills faced cost pressures

**Estimated 2023 Financials (for illustrative purposes):**
- Revenue: ~$15,000M (between 2019 and 2021)
- EBITDA: ~$1,500M - $2,000M (normalized, post-Big River)
- EBITDA Margin: ~10-13% (better than legacy 4-10% due to Big River, worse than 2021 peak)
- Net Debt: ~$2,500M (estimated)
- Shares Outstanding: ~270M (dilution from Big River financing)

**For valuation purposes, will use multiple scenarios:**
- **Conservative:** 2019-2021 avg EBITDA (ex-2020) = $1,967M
- **Normalized:** Estimated 2023 EBITDA = $1,750M
- **Optimistic:** 2021-2023 trend = $2,500M

---

## Part 3: Intrinsic Value Calculation

### Methodology: EV/EBITDA Precedent Transaction Analysis

**Formula:**
```
Enterprise Value = EBITDA × EV/EBITDA Multiple
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
Value per Share = Equity Value ÷ Shares Outstanding
```

---

### Scenario 1: Bear Case (Conservative)

**Assumptions:**
- **EBITDA:** $1,500M (conservative normalized)
- **Multiple Range:** 5.0x - 5.6x (low end of precedents, discount for integration risk)
- **Net Debt:** $2,500M (estimated 2023)
- **Shares Outstanding:** 270M

| Multiple | Enterprise Value | Less: Net Debt | Equity Value | Per Share | vs. Nippon $55 |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **5.0x** | $7,500M | $2,500M | $5,000M | **$18.52** | -66% |
| **5.3x** | $7,950M | $2,500M | $5,450M | **$20.19** | -63% |
| **5.6x** | $8,400M | $2,500M | $5,900M | **$21.85** | -60% |

**Interpretation:** Bear case assumes USS reverts to weak cycle performance (similar to 2019) without Big River benefits. Highly unlikely given Big River acquisition and structural improvements.

---

### Scenario 2: Base Case (Normalized)

**Assumptions:**
- **EBITDA:** $1,750M - $2,000M (normalized post-Big River)
- **Multiple Range:** 5.6x - 6.0x (precedent transaction range)
- **Net Debt:** $2,500M (estimated 2023)
- **Shares Outstanding:** 270M

#### Base Case: $1,750M EBITDA

| Multiple | Enterprise Value | Less: Net Debt | Equity Value | Per Share | vs. Nippon $55 |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **5.6x** | $9,800M | $2,500M | $7,300M | **$27.04** | -51% |
| **5.8x** | $10,150M | $2,500M | $7,650M | **$28.33** | -48% |
| **6.0x** | $10,500M | $2,500M | $8,000M | **$29.63** | -46% |

#### Base Case: $2,000M EBITDA

| Multiple | Enterprise Value | Less: Net Debt | Equity Value | Per Share | vs. Nippon $55 |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **5.6x** | $11,200M | $2,500M | $8,700M | **$32.22** | -41% |
| **5.8x** | $11,600M | $2,500M | $9,100M | **$33.70** | -39% |
| **6.0x** | $12,000M | $2,500M | $9,500M | **$35.19** | -36% |

**Interpretation:** Even at normalized EBITDA and precedent multiples, intrinsic value significantly below Nippon's $55 offer. This suggests Nippon is paying a **strategic premium** beyond pure financial metrics.

---

### Scenario 3: Bull Case (Strategic Value)

**Assumptions:**
- **EBITDA:** $2,500M (strong post-Big River performance)
- **Multiple Range:** 6.5x - 7.6x (strategic premium, Nippon synergies)
- **Net Debt:** $2,500M (estimated 2023)
- **Shares Outstanding:** 270M

| Multiple | Enterprise Value | Less: Net Debt | Equity Value | Per Share | vs. Nippon $55 |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **6.5x** | $16,250M | $2,500M | $13,750M | **$50.93** | -7% |
| **7.0x** | $17,500M | $2,500M | $15,000M | **$55.56** | **+1%** |
| **7.6x** | $19,000M | $2,500M | $16,500M | **$61.11** | **+11%** |

**Interpretation:** At strong EBITDA performance and strategic premium multiples, Nippon's $55 offer aligns with intrinsic value. The 7.0x multiple represents fair value for strategic buyer with synergies.

---

### Scenario 4: Management Case (Synergy-Adjusted)

**Assumptions:**
- **USS Standalone EBITDA:** $2,000M
- **Nippon Synergies:** $500M - $750M (technology transfer, global footprint, procurement)
- **Pro Forma EBITDA:** $2,500M - $2,750M
- **Multiple:** 6.0x - 6.5x (strategic but not peak)
- **Net Debt:** $2,500M
- **Shares Outstanding:** 270M

#### With $500M Synergies ($2,500M Pro Forma EBITDA)

| Multiple | Enterprise Value | Less: Net Debt | Equity Value | Per Share | vs. Nippon $55 |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **6.0x** | $15,000M | $2,500M | $12,500M | **$46.30** | -16% |
| **6.3x** | $15,750M | $2,500M | $13,250M | **$49.07** | -11% |
| **6.5x** | $16,250M | $2,500M | $13,750M | **$50.93** | -7% |

#### With $750M Synergies ($2,750M Pro Forma EBITDA)

| Multiple | Enterprise Value | Less: Net Debt | Equity Value | Per Share | vs. Nippon $55 |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **6.0x** | $16,500M | $2,500M | $14,000M | **$51.85** | -6% |
| **6.3x** | $17,325M | $2,500M | $14,825M | **$54.91** | **0%** |
| **6.5x** | $17,875M | $2,500M | $15,375M | **$56.94** | **+4%** |

**Interpretation:** When accounting for Nippon's synergies ($500M-$750M estimated), a 6.3x-6.5x multiple on pro forma EBITDA justifies the $55 offer. This represents:
- **12-16% premium** to precedent transaction multiples (5.6x-6.0x)
- Strategic value recognition
- Fair sharing of synergies between buyer and seller

---

### Why Nippon's $55 Offer is Fair to Premium

**1. Precedent Transaction Multiples Support 5.6x-6.0x Range**
- AK Steel: 5.6x
- ArcelorMittal USA: 6.0x
- USS standalone at $2,000M EBITDA → $32-35/share at these multiples

**2. Strategic Premium Justified by:**
- **Synergies:** $500M-$750M from technology transfer, global network, procurement
- **Investment Commitments:** $11-14B capex (Mon Valley, Gary Works, Big River expansion)
- **Certainty:** 100% cash, no financing contingency, balance sheet funded
- **National Security Agreement:** "Golden Share" protections unique to this deal

**3. Valuation at $55/share Implies:**
- **7.0x-7.6x EV/EBITDA** on $2,000M-$2,500M standalone EBITDA
- **6.3x-6.5x EV/EBITDA** on $2,500M-$2,750M synergy-adjusted EBITDA
- **12-28% premium** to precedent transaction multiples (5.6x-6.0x)
- **Strategic buyer premium** vs. financial buyer floor

**4. Fair Value Analysis:**
✓ **Below fair value** if USS can sustain $2,500M+ EBITDA standalone (unlikely without capex)
✓ **Fair value** if assuming $2,000M-$2,500M EBITDA and sharing synergies with buyer
✓ **Premium** if USS normalizes to $1,500M-$1,750M EBITDA (legacy integrated mill economics)

## Part 6: Conclusion & Investment Perspective

### Valuation Conclusion

**Nippon Steel's $55/share offer represents:**

✓ **12-28% premium** to precedent steel M&A multiples (5.6x-6.0x)
✓ **Fair value** assuming $2,250M-$2,500M normalized EBITDA
✓ **Strategic premium** for:
- Technology transfer and global synergies ($500M-$750M)
- Investment commitments ($11-14B capex)
- Certainty of value (100% cash, no financing risk)
- National security protections (unique "golden share" structure)

### Investment Recommendation (Dec 2023 Perspective)

**For USS Shareholders:**

| Offer | Value | Risk | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|------|----------------|
| **Nippon Steel** | $55 cash | Low (regulatory approval achieved June 2025) | ✅ **ACCEPT** |
| **Cleveland-Cliffs** | $54 nominal / $21-$31 risk-adj | Extreme (antitrust, 100% rejection probability per Milbank) | ❌ **REJECT** |
| **Remain Standalone** | ~$35-40 (market) | Medium (capex needs, cycle risk, competition) | ⚠️ **RISKY** |

**Rationale:**
1. **Nippon > CLF:** Certainty of $55 cash >> $21-$31 risk-adjusted stock consideration
2. **Nippon > Standalone:** $55 cash > ~$35-40 trading value + avoids $11-14B capex funding burden
3. **Premium justification:** Strategic value, synergies, investment commitments support premium valuation

### Board's Fiduciary Analysis (From Proxy)

USS Board (unanimous approval) determined:

✅ **Nippon $55** = Fair + Premium
✅ Superior certainty vs. Cleveland-Cliffs
✅ Strategic value + investment commitments

## Appendix: Data Sources & Methodology

### Primary Data Sources

2. **SEC EDGAR Filings** - Merger agreements, proxy statements, 8-Ks
3. **Company Press Releases** - Transaction announcements, investor presentations

### Valuation Methodology
