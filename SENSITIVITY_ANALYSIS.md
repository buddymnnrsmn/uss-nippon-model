# USS / Nippon Steel Merger: Sensitivity Analysis

## Overview

This document presents sensitivity analysis on key valuation drivers to understand how changes in assumptions impact share value. All sensitivities are run against the Base Case unless otherwise noted.

---

## 1. Steel Price Sensitivity

Steel prices are the most significant driver of valuation. A 10% change in realized prices swings value by $15-25/share.

### Price Factor Impact on Valuation

| Price Factor | USS Value | Nippon Value | vs $55 Offer | 10Y FCF |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| 70% | $2.19 | $7.71 | -$47.29 | $0.7B |
| 80% | $15.56 | $26.79 | -$28.21 | $4.0B |
| 85% | $26.37 | $41.83 | -$13.17 | $6.7B |
| 90% | $38.37 | $58.50 | +$3.50 | $9.7B |
| 95% (Base) | $51.53 | $76.79 | +$21.79 | $13.1B |
| 100% | $65.88 | $96.71 | +$41.71 | $16.7B |
| 105% | $81.40 | $118.26 | +$63.26 | $20.7B |
| 110% | $98.10 | $141.43 | +$86.43 | $24.9B |
| 115% | $115.98 | $166.22 | +$111.22 | $29.4B |
| 120% | $133.95 | $190.81 | +$135.81 | $34.1B |

### Key Insights

- Breakeven for $55 offer: ~88% price factor (Nippon view)
- Each 5% price change = ~$12-15/share value change
- At 70% prices (severe downturn), equity value nearly wiped out
- At 110%+ prices, significant upside beyond offer price

### Implied HRC Prices by Scenario

| Price Factor | Implied HRC ($/ton) | Historical Context |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 70% | $476 | 2015-2016 trough |
| 85% | $578 | COVID low (2020) |
| 95% | $646 | Mid-cycle normal |
| 100% | $680 | 2023 average |
| 110% | $748 | 2022 elevated |
| 120% | $816 | 2021 peak levels |

---

## 2. WACC Sensitivity

The discount rate significantly impacts present value. Nippon's IRP-adjusted WACC (~7.5%) vs USS standalone (~10.9%) creates a 3.4% advantage.

### USS Standalone WACC Impact

| WACC | Share Price | Enterprise Value | vs Base Case |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 8.0% | $70.43 | $16.5B | +$20.29 |
| 9.0% | $62.05 | $14.7B | +$11.91 |
| 10.0% | $55.26 | $13.1B | +$5.12 |
| 10.9% (Base) | $50.14 | $12.0B | - |
| 12.0% | $44.84 | $10.8B | -$5.30 |
| 13.0% | $40.74 | $9.9B | -$9.40 |
| 14.0% | $37.17 | $9.1B | -$12.97 |

### Key Insights

- Each 1% WACC change = ~$7-8/share value change
- At 10% WACC, USS value equals $55 offer
- WACC above 12% pushes USS value below $45/share
- Nippon's 7.5% IRP WACC adds ~$25/share vs USS standalone

### WACC Comparison

| Perspective | WACC | Base Case Value |
|-------------|------|-----------------|
| USS Standalone | 10.9% | $50.14 |
| Nippon (IRP-adjusted) | 7.55% | $74.87 |
| WACC Arbitrage | 3.35% | +$24.73/share |

## 3. Terminal Growth Sensitivity

Terminal growth assumptions affect the perpetuity value in the Gordon Growth model.

### Terminal Growth Impact

| Terminal Growth | USS Value | Nippon Value | Change from Base |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| -1.0% | $47.52 | $67.63 | -$7.24 |
| 0.0% | $48.71 | $70.77 | -$4.10 |
| 0.5% | $49.39 | $72.67 | -$2.20 |
| 1.0% (Base) | $50.14 | $74.87 | - |
| 1.5% | $50.97 | $77.43 | +$2.56 |
| 2.0% | $51.89 | $80.45 | +$5.58 |
| 2.5% | $52.92 | $84.06 | +$9.19 |

### Key Insights

- Each 0.5% terminal growth change = ~$2-3/share
- Terminal growth has less impact than steel prices or WACC
- Negative terminal growth (industry decline) reduces value by $7/share
- 2%+ growth optimistic for mature steel industry

---

## 4. Exit Multiple Sensitivity

The exit multiple (EV/EBITDA) affects terminal value via the comparable company method.

### Exit Multiple Impact

| Exit Multiple | USS Value | Nippon Value | Change from Base |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| 3.5x | $47.89 | $71.81 | -$3.06 |
| 4.0x | $49.01 | $73.34 | -$1.53 |
| 4.5x (Base) | $50.14 | $74.87 | - |
| 5.0x | $51.27 | $76.40 | +$1.53 |
| 5.5x | $52.39 | $77.93 | +$3.06 |
| 6.0x | $53.52 | $79.46 | +$4.59 |
| 6.5x | $54.64 | $80.99 | +$6.12 |

### Key Insights

- Each 0.5x multiple change = ~$1.50/share
- Steel sector trades at 4-6x forward EBITDA historically
- Multiple expansion to 6x+ requires improved growth outlook
- Multiple compression to 3.5x in downturn reduces value by $3/share

### Comparable Company Multiples (Reference)

| Company | EV/EBITDA | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Nucor | 5.5-6.5x | Premium for EAF leadership |
| Cleveland-Cliffs | 4.0-5.0x | Integrated, higher leverage |
| Steel Dynamics | 5.0-6.0x | Efficient mini mill |
| ArcelorMittal | 3.5-4.5x | Global diversified |
| USS (Historical) | 4.0-5.0x | Discount for Flat-Rolled exposure |

## 5. Execution Factor Sensitivity (NSA Mandated CapEx)

The execution factor measures what percentage of projected investment benefits are actually achieved.

### Execution Factor Impact

| Execution | USS Value* | Nippon Value | vs $55 Offer | 10Y FCF |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| 50% | $57.28 | $92.34 | +$37.34 | $11.5B |
| 60% | $59.67 | $95.85 | +$40.85 | $12.0B |
| 70% | $62.05 | $99.36 | +$44.36 | $12.5B |
| 75% | $63.25 | $101.11 | +$46.11 | $12.8B |
| 80% | $64.44 | $102.87 | +$47.87 | $13.1B |
| 90% | $66.83 | $106.37 | +$51.37 | $13.6B |
| 100% | $69.21 | $109.88 | +$54.88 | $14.1B |

*USS Values shown are BEFORE financing costs. See "USS Standalone Financing Impact" below.

### USS Standalone Financing Impact

**Critical Insight:** If USS tried to execute the NSA investment program alone, financing costs would destroy value:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| USS Value (no financing costs) | $69.21/share |
| Financing Gap (cumulative negative FCF) | $3,493M |
| Equity Dilution | 17.8% (40M new shares) |
| WACC Increase | +0.25% |
| USS Value (with financing costs) | $48.66/share |
| **Value Destroyed by Financing** | **$20.55/share** |

The USS - No Sale value with all NSA projects ($48.66) is actually **lower** than the Base Case ($50.14). This proves USS cannot create value from these investments alone - only Nippon can fund them without penalty.

### Key Insights

- Even at 50% execution, Nippon value exceeds $55 offer by $37/share
- Each 10% execution improvement = ~$3.50/share
- Full execution adds $17.54/share vs 50% execution
- BR2 Mini Mill benefits are excluded from haircut (already committed)
- **USS standalone financing costs destroy more value than the investments create**

### Execution Risk Breakdown

| Project | Full EBITDA (2033) | At 75% Execution |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Gary Works BF | $402M | $302M |
| Mon Valley HSM | $130M | $98M |
| Greenfield Mini Mill | $274M | $206M |
| Mining Investment | $80M | $60M |
| Fairfield Works | $60M | $45M |
| Total Incremental | $946M | $710M |

Note: BR2 Mini Mill ($560M EBITDA) not haircut as it's already committed.

| 100% Price | $112.74 | $97.42 | $85.66 | $76.29 | $68.59 |
| 110% Price | $163.95 | $142.41 | $125.91 | $112.74 | $101.92 |

### Reading the Matrix

- Green zone (above $55): Price 90%+ at WACC below 9.5%
- Yellow zone ($40-55): Price 85-90% or higher WACC
- Red zone (below $40): Price below 85% or WACC above 10%

### Probability-Weighted Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Nippon Value | Weighted |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Bull (105% price, 7% WACC) | 15% | $130 | $19.50 |
| Base (95% price, 7.5% WACC) | 40% | $75 | $30.00 |
| Moderate (90% price, 8.5% WACC) | 30% | $51 | $15.30 |
| Bear (85% price, 10% WACC) | 15% | $35 | $5.25 |
| Expected Value | 100% | | $70.05 |

## 7. Interest Rate Parity Sensitivity

Changes in US/Japan interest rate spreads affect Nippon's IRP-adjusted WACC.

### US 10-Year Treasury Impact

| US 10Y Rate | Rate Spread | IRP WACC | Nippon Value |
|-------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 3.0% | 2.25% | 6.26% | $91.23 |
| 3.5% | 2.75% | 6.78% | $83.93 |
| 4.0% | 3.25% | 7.30% | $77.68 |
| 4.25% (Current) | 3.50% | 7.55% | $74.87 |
| 4.5% | 3.75% | 7.81% | $72.25 |
| 5.0% | 4.25% | 8.33% | $67.48 |
| 5.5% | 4.75% | 8.84% | $63.25 |

Note: Japan 10-Year JGB assumed constant at 0.75%

### Key Insights

- Each 50bp US rate increase = ~$4-5/share decrease in Nippon value
- Rate convergence (lower US rates) benefits Nippon valuation
- Rate divergence (higher US rates) narrows WACC advantage
- At 5.5% US rates, Nippon value still exceeds $55 offer

## 10. Breakeven Analysis

### What Assumptions Justify the $55 Offer?

| Variable | Breakeven Value | vs Base Case |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Steel Price Factor | 88% | -7% |
| USS WACC | 10.0% | -0.9% |
| IRP WACC | 9.8% | +2.3% |
| Terminal Growth | -3.5% | -4.5% |
| Exit Multiple | 2.0x | -2.5x |

### Interpretation

- Steel prices would need to fall 7% below base case for $55 to be fair
- USS WACC would need to drop to 10.0% (from 10.9%)
- Terminal growth would need to be deeply negative (-3.5%)
- The $55 offer is conservative under most reasonable assumptions

---

## Conclusion

### Most Sensitive Variables (Monitor Closely)

1. Steel Prices - Largest single driver of value
2. Interest Rate Differentials - Affects IRP WACC advantage
3. Execution Success - Determines investment program value

### Least Sensitive Variables (Less Critical)

1. Exit Multiple - Modest impact on terminal value
2. Terminal Growth - Limited swing in mature industry

### Risk-Adjusted View

- Expected Nippon Value: ~$70-85/share
- Downside Protection: Value exceeds $55 in most scenarios
- Upside Potential: $100+ with strong execution and prices

The sensitivity analysis supports the conclusion that the $55 offer provides fair value with downside protection, while Nippon captures significant upside through its lower cost of capital and investment program.
