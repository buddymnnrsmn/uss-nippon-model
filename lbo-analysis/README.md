# USS LBO Model

## Overview
This directory contains research, scripts, and data for building an LBO (Leveraged Buyout) model for U.S. Steel Corporation.

## Structure
- `research/` - Markdown documents with research findings
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for LBO calculations
- `data/` - Data files and market information

## Research Tasks
1. Debt market conditions (SOFR, spreads, loan terms)
2. Comparable LBO transactions (steel/industrial)
3. USS capital structure analysis
4. Downside/stress scenarios
5. LBO model structure and assumptions

## Integration
This LBO model complements the existing DCF model in the parent directory by:
- Providing a financial buyer perspective
- Demonstrating why Nippon's strategic offer is superior to PE alternatives
- Establishing valuation floor via LBO returns analysis
