2. Undrawn credit facilities: $2.226B available capacity
3. Investment-grade coupon levels indicate market access

- **2025**: $73M (routine)
- **2026**: $530M (includes $350M convertible notes)
  - Convertible notes likely to convert if stock > $17.37 (130% × $13.36)
  - Remaining $180M refinanceable in favorable market conditions

## 8. CAPITAL STRUCTURE IMPLICATIONS FOR LBO ANALYSIS

### Key Findings

1. **Current leverage is very conservative:** 0.57x Net Debt/EBITDA provides substantial capacity for LBO financing[^1][^3]

2. **Strong liquidity position:** $5.17B exceeds 2+ years of debt service requirements[^1]

3. **Favorable debt maturity profile:** No significant maturities until 2026; allows multi-year paydown post-acquisition[^1]

4. **Well-funded pension liabilities:** 103% funded; no cash drain from pension contributions[^1]

5. **Investment-grade debt profile:** Access to public debt markets at reasonable spreads[^1]

6. **Covenant structure is flexible:** Most covenants only trigger at stress levels; provide operational flexibility[^1]

7. **Significant financing capacity:** $3.0-3.5B estimated available for strategic financing[^3]

### LBO Financing Roadmap

**Estimated Pro Forma Target Capital Structure (Post-LBO):**[^6]
- **Entry assumption**: $55/share × 225M shares = $12,375M equity value
- **Add**: Net debt $1,208M
- **Entry EV**: ~$13,583M
- **Entry EV/EBITDA**: ~6.4x (based on $2,139M EBITDA)

**Estimated New Financing:**[^3][^6]
- **Total debt target**: 5.0x EBITDA = ~$10,695M
- **Less existing debt**: $4,156M
- **New debt required**: ~$6,539M
- **Equity contribution**: ~$5,844M (47% of purchase price)

**Pro Forma Metrics:**
- **Pro forma total debt**: ~$10,695M
- **Pro forma leverage**: 5.0x EBITDA
- **Annual interest expense**: ~$856M (at 8.0% blended rate)
- **Interest coverage**: 2.5x (EBITDA $2,139M / Interest $856M)

**Risk Assessment:**[^4][^7]
- Steel industry is highly cyclical
- 2015-2016 crisis saw EBITDA margins compress from 16% to 8%
- 5.0x leverage would be vulnerable in downturn scenario
- Conservative leverage recommendation: 3.5-4.0x for steel companies

---

## 9. RISK FACTORS

### Industry and Operational Risks[^4][^5][^7]

1. **Market Cyclicality**: Steel industry highly cyclical; EBITDA can decline 50%+ in downturns
   - 2008-2009: HRC prices fell 62% ($1,000 → $380/ton)
   - 2015-2016: EBITDA margins compressed 50% industry-wide

2. **Commodity Price Exposure**: Iron ore, scrap, and energy costs impact margins
   - Raw material commitments: $5,180M for 2024
   - Energy costs subject to volatility

3. **Labor Agreements**: USW contracts through September 1, 2026 with 5% annual wage escalations[^2]
   - Limited operational flexibility during contract period
   - Pension contribution increases ($3.50 → $4.00/hour)

4. **Capital Intensity**: Strategic projects represent significant cash commitments[^1]
   - BR2 expansion, dual coating line, pellet plant
   - $1,479M contractual capital commitments

5. **Environmental Obligations**: Regulatory changes could increase remediation costs[^5]
   - $367M annual environmental expenditures projected
   - Long-term remediation liabilities: $107M reserves

6. **Trade and Regulatory Risk**: Section 232 tariffs, import quotas, and trade policy uncertainty[^7]

### Financial Risks

7. **Refinancing Risk**: $530M due in 2026 (primarily convertible notes)[^1]
   - Conversion price: $13.36/share (stock must reach $17.37 for conversion)
   - If stock underperforms, cash refinancing required

8. **Covenant Risk**: USSK Net Debt/EBITDA < 3.50x covenant could become restrictive in downturn[^1]

9. **Pension Funding Risk**: While currently overfunded, actuarial assumptions could change
   - Interest rate sensitivity
   - Asset return volatility

---

## 10. CONCLUSIONS

USS Corporation maintains a **moderate and well-structured capital structure** as of December 31, 2023, characterized by:

- **Total Debt:** $4.2 billion with well-laddered maturities extending to 2053
- **Strong Liquidity:** $5.17 billion in available resources (1.2x annual revenue)
- **Conservative Leverage:** 0.57x Net Debt/EBITDA with substantial covenant headroom
- **Investment-Grade Profile:** Access to public debt markets with competitive coupon levels
- **Favorable Pension Position:** Both DB pension and OPEB plans overfunded (103%)
- **Operational Flexibility:** All major credit facilities undrawn with $2.2B+ available capacity

The capital structure supports both ongoing operations and strategic initiatives while providing the **foundation for LBO transaction financing** with estimated capacity for $3.0-3.5 billion in incremental debt above current levels.

**LBO Feasibility:** The analysis indicates USS could support 5.0x leverage (~$10.7B total debt) based on current EBITDA, but this structure would be **vulnerable to cyclical downturns** characteristic of the steel industry. Conservative leverage of 3.5-4.0x EBITDA is recommended for steel sector LBOs.[^3][^4][^7]

**Strategic Implications:** The strong balance sheet and available financing capacity make USS an attractive acquisition target for strategic buyers with access to low-cost capital, though financial buyers would face significant return hurdles given cyclicality and capital intensity requirements.
