## 6. Implications for USS LBO Financing (as of December 31, 2024)

### Current Market Environment

The market environment as of December 31, 2024 is highly conducive to LBO financing for an industrial company like USS:

**Favorable Factors:**
1. **Low Financing Costs:** With SOFR at 4.49% and spreads at historic lows, all-in borrowing costs are attractive
2. **Strong Liquidity:** Record issuance volumes demonstrate robust market capacity for large transactions
3. **Declining Rates:** Federal Reserve rate cuts throughout 2024 improved debt service economics
4. **Flexible Structures:** Covenant-lite and borrower-friendly terms widely available
5. **Multiple Financing Sources:** Both syndicated and private credit markets actively competing

**Challenging Factors:**
1. **Cyclical Industry Risk:** Steel sector volatility may require more conservative leverage
2. **Tight Spreads:** Limited room for spread widening without impacting refinancing costs
3. **High Leverage Standards:** Market allowing 4.9x leverage may be aggressive for cyclical industrial
4. **Default Rate Concerns:** 5.6% leveraged loan default rate suggests credit stress in some sectors

### Recommended Structure for USS LBO (December 31, 2024 Terms)

**Target Leverage:** 4.5x - 5.0x Total Debt/EBITDA
- Slightly conservative for industrial/steel sector cyclicality
- In line with 2024 market average of 4.9x
- Provides cushion for potential EBITDA volatility

**Suggested Tranche Mix:**

| Component | Amount (EBITDA Multiple) | Pricing |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Revolving Credit Facility** | 0.4x - 0.5x | SOFR + 300 bps (undrawn) |
| **Term Loan A** | 1.0x - 1.5x | SOFR + 350 bps, 5-7 year, amortizing |
| **Term Loan B** | 2.5x - 3.0x | SOFR + 375-400 bps, 7-8 year, 1% amort |
| **High Yield Bonds** | 1.0x - 1.5x | 7.00% - 7.50% coupon, 8-10 year |
| **Total Debt** | 4.9x - 5.5x | |
| **Equity** | 30-40% of total cap | |

**Expected All-In Cost of Debt:**
- SOFR Base Rate: 4.49% (year-end 2024)
- TLA: 7.99% (4.49% + 3.50%)
- TLB: 8.24% (4.49% + 3.75%)
- HY Bonds: 7.25% (fixed coupon)
- **Blended Cost:** ~7.7% - 8.0%

### Risk Considerations for USS

1. **Cyclical Industry:** Steel sector EBITDA volatility warrants conservative leverage and adequate liquidity reserves

2. **Interest Rate Risk:** While rates declined in 2024, SOFR-based debt exposes to rate fluctuations
   - Potential mitigation: Interest rate caps or collars
   - Monitor: Forward SOFR curve for 2025-2026

3. **Refinancing Risk:** Tight spreads could widen, increasing refinancing costs
   - Potential mitigation: Longer tenor debt (7-8 years), ladder maturities

4. **Covenant Structure:** Balance covenant-lite flexibility with adequate protections
   - Consider: Springing leverage covenant on revolver
   - Monitor: Maintenance covenants on TLA tranche

5. **Market Timing:** December 2024 represents favorable financing window
   - Spreads at historic lows
   - Strong market liquidity
   - Federal Reserve rate cutting cycle underway
