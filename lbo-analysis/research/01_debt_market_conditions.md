**Research Date:** January 24, 2026
**Focus:** Industrial/Steel Company LBO Financing
**Time Period:** 2024-2026

---

## Executive Summary

The leveraged finance market in 2024-2025 has been characterized by historically tight spreads, robust issuance volumes, and increasingly borrower-friendly terms. SOFR-based pricing has become the standard, with Term Loan B spreads in the 350-400 basis points range for B-rated credits. The market is positioned for continued strength in 2026, driven by growing M&A activity and favorable refinancing conditions, though spreads are near historic lows and may face pressure from macroeconomic uncertainty.

## 5. Market Trends and Observations

### Positive Trends

1. **Spread Tightening:** Credit spreads remain at or near historic lows, reflecting strong investor demand and favorable credit conditions

2. **Strong Refinancing Market:** High volume of refinancing activity as borrowers take advantage of favorable terms to extend maturities and reduce costs

3. **CLO Demand:** Continued strong demand from CLO investors supporting the leveraged loan market

4. **Declining Default Rates:** Default rates well below historical averages and expected to decline further in 2026

5. **Return of TLA:** Term Loan A debt is "back in fashion" as institutional investors seek higher-quality senior secured exposure

### Concerns and Risks

1. **Tight Spreads:** Historically tight spreads leave little room for error and limited compensation for risk

2. **Covenant Quality:** Proliferation of covenant-lite structures reduces lender protections

3. **Hidden Leverage:** Aggressive liability management exercises and sale-leaseback transactions obscuring true leverage levels

4. **Market Competition:** Intense competition between syndicated and private credit markets driving aggressive terms

5. **Macroeconomic Uncertainty:** Tariff policies, inflation risks, and geopolitical tensions could disrupt favorable market conditions

6. **Credit Differentiation:** While BB credits have tightened, CCC-rated credits have widened, indicating increased market discrimination

### Private Credit Competition

**Market Dynamics:**
- Private credit lenders maintain competitive advantage in speed and certainty of execution
- BSL (broadly syndicated loans) and high yield markets offering more competitive pricing
- Middle market particularly competitive with "too much capital chasing too few deals"
- Private credit better positioned during periods of market volatility

## 6. Implications for USS LBO Financing

### Favorable Market Conditions

The current market environment is highly conducive to LBO financing for an industrial company like USS:

1. **Historical Lows in Pricing:** SOFR-based loan spreads are at record lows, reducing debt service costs

2. **Strong Demand:** Robust institutional investor demand supporting large deal financing

3. **Flexible Structures:** Covenant-lite terms increasingly available even for industrial credits

4. **Multiple Financing Sources:** Both syndicated and private credit markets actively competing

### Potential Structure for USS LBO

**Recommended Leverage:** 4.5x - 5.0x Total Debt/EBITDA
- Conservative for industrial/steel sector cyclicality
- Slightly below 2024 average of 4.9x due to sector volatility

**Suggested Tranche Mix:**
- **Revolver:** SOFR + 300 bps (undrawn)
- **Term Loan B:** SOFR + 375-400 bps (3.0x - 3.5x EBITDA)
- **High Yield Bonds:** 7.00% - 7.50% coupon (1.5x - 2.0x EBITDA)

**Blended All-In Cost:** Approximately 7.0% - 7.5%

### Risk Considerations

1. **Cyclical Industry:** Steel sector volatility may warrant more conservative leverage
2. **Spread Widening Risk:** Current tight spreads could widen, increasing refinancing costs
3. **Covenant Flexibility:** While covenant-lite is available, maintenance covenants may provide better alignment
4. **Rate Volatility:** Even with declining SOFR forecasts, sudden rate increases could stress debt service
