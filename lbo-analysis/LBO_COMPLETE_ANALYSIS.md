# USS LBO Complete Analysis: Returns + Stress Testing

**Analysis Date:** December 31, 2024
**Prepared by:** RAMBAS Team Capstone Project

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive LBO analysis demonstrates two critical findings:

1. **RETURNS**: PE firms cannot generate adequate returns at $55/share (max IRR: 7.3% vs. 20% target)
2. **RISK**: Even if returns were acceptable, 5.0x leverage creates unacceptable bankruptcy risk

**Conclusion:** Nippon's all-equity strategic acquisition at $55/share is **vastly superior** to any LBO alternative.

## Part I: Returns Analysis

### LBO Returns at $55/Share Across Scenarios

| Scenario | 2024 EBITDA | Entry Multiple | Initial Equity | Exit Proceeds | MoIC | IRR | Meets 20% Target? |
|----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|------|-----|-------------------|
| **Conservative** | $898M | 15.1x | $9,500M | $6,419M | 0.68x | **-7.5%** | ✗ |
| **Wall Street** | $1,547M | 8.8x | $6,349M | $6,626M | 1.04x | **0.9%** | ✗ |
| **Management** | $1,476M | 9.2x | $6,694M | $5,948M | 0.89x | **-2.3%** | ✗ |
| **Base Case** | $1,704M | 8.0x | $5,590M | $7,967M | 1.43x | **7.3%** | ✗ |

**Key Findings:**
- **Maximum IRR achievable:** 7.3% (Base Case optimistic scenario)
- **Gap to PE target (20%):** -12.7 percentage points
- **Conservative scenario:** Negative returns (-7.5% IRR, 0.68x MoIC)
- **All scenarios fail** to meet minimum PE hurdle of 15% IRR

### Maximum PE Acquisition Price

To achieve 20% IRR, PE firms would need to acquire at:

| Scenario | Max PE Price | vs. Nippon Offer | Required Discount |
|----------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Would not pursue | N/A | N/A |
| Wall Street | ~$40/share | -$15 | -27% |
| Management | ~$38/share | -$17 | -31% |
| Base Case | ~$42/share | -$13 | -24% |

**Average maximum PE price: $40/share**
**Nippon's offer: $55/share**
**Premium over PE alternative: $15/share (38%)**

## Part II: Stress Testing Results

### Covenant Compliance Matrix

| Scenario | Yr1 EBITDA | Total Leverage | Interest Coverage | DS Coverage | Status |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Base Case** | $1,704M | **6.08x** | **1.85x** | 1.75x | **DEFAULT** ⚠️ |
| **Mild Downturn** | $893M | **11.60x** | **0.97x** | 0.92x | **DEFAULT** 🔴 |
| **Moderate Crisis (2015-16)** | $154M | **67.41x** | **0.17x** | 0.16x | **BANKRUPTCY** 💀 |
| **Severe Crisis (2008-09)** | $76M | **136.01x** | **0.08x** | 0.08x | **BANKRUPTCY** 💀 |

**Covenant Requirements:**
- **Leverage < 5.0x** (violated in all scenarios)
- **Interest Coverage > 2.0x** (violated in all scenarios)
- **Fixed Charge Coverage > 1.25x** (violated in all scenarios except base)

### Critical Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Base Case Already in Covenant Breach

Even with **optimistic** Base Case assumptions:
- Leverage: 6.08x (21% above 5.0x covenant)
- Interest coverage: 1.85x (below 2.0x minimum)
- Annual debt service: $971M (57% of EBITDA)

**Result:** Immediate covenant waiver required; no operational flexibility

#### 2. Mild Downturn Triggers Crisis

15% price decline + 8% volume contraction (realistic cyclical scenario):
- EBITDA drops 48% ($1,704M → $893M)
- Leverage explodes to 11.60x
- Interest coverage collapses to 0.97x
- **Company cannot service debt from operations**

**Result:** Bankruptcy filing likely within 12-18 months

#### 3. Historical Crisis = Immediate Bankruptcy

**2015-2016 Steel Crisis Replay:**
- EBITDA: $154M (91% decline)
- Cannot cover even interest expense ($919M)
- Leverage: 67.41x
- **Equity wiped out**

**2008-2009 Financial Crisis Replay:**
- EBITDA: $76M (96% decline)
- Cash interest shortfall: $843M annually
- Leverage: 136.01x
- **Chapter 11 within quarters**

### Minimum EBITDA Requirements by Leverage

| Target Leverage | Total Debt | Equity % | Min EBITDA (2.0x Int Coverage) | Covenant Status |
|-----------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| 3.0x | $6,216M | 58% | $2,072M | ✓ PASS |
| 3.5x | $7,252M | 51% | $2,072M | ✓ PASS |
| 4.0x | $8,288M | 44% | $2,072M | ✓ PASS |
| 4.5x | $9,324M | 37% | $2,072M | ✓ PASS |
| **5.0x** | **$10,360M** | **30%** | **$2,072M** | **⚠️ WARNING** |
| 5.5x | $11,396M | 23% | $2,072M | ✗ FAIL |
| 6.0x | $11,840M | 20% | $1,973M | ✗ FAIL |

**Key Insight:** To survive even a mild downturn, USS LBO requires:
- **Maximum leverage: 4.0x EBITDA**
- **Minimum equity: 44%**
- **Total debt: $8.3B (vs. $10.4B at 5.0x)**

But this conservative structure **destroys returns**:
- At 4.0x leverage with 44% equity: IRR falls to ~3-5%
- Even further below PE return thresholds

## Part III: Integrated Analysis - The Death Spiral

### The LBO Trap for USS

```
Higher Leverage → Better Returns
         ↓
But Higher Leverage → Bankruptcy Risk
         ↓
Lower Leverage → Safety
         ↓
But Lower Leverage → Unacceptable Returns
         ↓
RESULT: No viable LBO structure exists at $55/share
```

### Return-Risk Matrix

| Leverage | IRR (Base Case) | Covenant Breach Risk | Mild Downturn Survival | Severe Crisis Survival |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 3.0x | 3% | Low | Medium | Low |
| 3.5x | 4% | Low | Medium | Very Low |
| 4.0x | 5% | Medium | Medium-Low | Very Low |
| 4.5x | 6% | Medium-High | Low | None |
| **5.0x** | **7%** | **High** | **Very Low** | **None** |
| 5.5x | 8% | Very High | None | None |
| 6.0x | 9% | Extreme | None | None |

**Sweet spot for PE:** 3.5-4.0x leverage
- But this only generates 3-5% IRR (vs. 20% target)
- **Gap too large to bridge**

## Part IV: Why the $14B NSA CapEx is Unfundable

### Annual Cash Flow Allocation Under LBO (Base Case)

| Item | Amount ($M) | % of EBITDA |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **EBITDA** | 1,704 | 100% |
| Less: Interest Expense | (920) | -54% |
| Less: Cash Taxes | (196) | -11% |
| Less: Maintenance CapEx | (600) | -35% |
| **Operating Cash Flow** | **(12)** | **-1%** |
| Less: Mandatory Amortization | (52) | -3% |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **(64)** | **-4%** |

**Result:** NEGATIVE free cash flow even before growth CapEx

### NSA Investment Program Requirements

| Project | CapEx ($B) | Timeline | Annual Avg |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Gary Works BF | $3.1 | 2024-2028 | $620M |
| Mon Valley HSM | $1.0 | 2024-2027 | $250M |
| BR2 Mini Mill | $3.0 | 2023-2025 | $1,000M |
| Greenfield Mini Mill | $1.0 | 2025-2028 | $250M |
| Mining Investment | $0.8 | 2024-2029 | $160M |
| Other Projects | $5.1 | Various | $500M |
| **Total NSA** | **$14.0** | **2024-2035** | **$1,167M** |

**Annual growth CapEx under NSA:** $1,167M
**Available FCF under LBO:** -$64M
**Financing gap:** $1,231M annually

### Why Debt Covenants Block Funding

**Covenant headroom analysis:**
- Current leverage: 6.08x (already in breach)
- Additional debt capacity: $0 (cannot borrow more)
- Need to borrow: $1.2B annually for CapEx
- **Impossible under existing covenants**

**Cash sweep mechanism:**
- 75% of excess cash goes to debt paydown
- Even if EBITDA improves, cash is locked
- Cannot accumulate equity for investments

**PE playbook conflict:**
- PE firms maximize cash extraction (dividends, fees)
- NSA requires cash injection ($14B over 10 years)
- **Fundamentally incompatible business models**

## Part V: Nippon Strategic Advantage - The Perfect Buyer

### Nippon vs. PE: Head-to-Head Comparison

| Factor | PE Buyer (LBO @ 5.0x) | Nippon Steel (All-Equity) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Max Acquisition Price** | $40/share | $55/share (offered) |
| **Entry Financing** | $10.4B debt, $4.4B equity | $12.4B equity, $0 debt |
| **Annual Debt Service** | $971M (57% of EBITDA) | $0 |
| **Interest Coverage** | 1.85x (covenant breach) | ∞ (no debt) |
| **Can Fund NSA CapEx?** | ✗ NO (covenant limits) | ✓ YES ($14B committed) |
| **Mild Downturn Survival** | Bankruptcy likely | Safe (no debt service) |
| **Crisis Survival** | Chapter 11 | Operational flexibility |
| **Investment Horizon** | 5-7 years (forced exit) | Permanent capital |
| **Value Creation** | Cost cuts, asset sales | Strategic investment + synergies |
| **Returns to Sponsor** | -7.5% to 7.3% IRR | $20/share value creation |
| **Political/Union** | Adversarial (job cuts) | Collaborative (employment commitment) |

### Nippon's Unique Capabilities

**1. Balance Sheet Strength**
- Market cap: $27B
- Can absorb $14B investment without leverage
- Investment-grade credit rating
- Access to low-cost Japanese debt markets

**2. Strategic Synergies**
- Technology transfer (energy efficiency, advanced steels)
- Supply chain integration (Asia-Pacific + North America)
- Procurement savings (scale advantages)
- Best practice sharing (Nippon ranked #1 globally)

**3. Long-Term Value Creation**
- Not focused on quarterly EBITDA
- Can weather 2-3 year downturns
- Commitment to R&D and innovation
- Employee development and retention

**4. Cost of Capital Advantage**
```
Same cash flows, different valuations:

At 20% PE required return:    $40/share
At 10.9% USS standalone WACC:  $50/share
At 7.5% Nippon WACC:          $75/share

Nippon pays $55 → Captures $20/share of value
PE cannot pay $55 → Would need $15 discount
```

## Part VI: Conclusions and Strategic Implications

### Key Findings Summary

#### 1. Returns: PE Cannot Compete

✗ Maximum IRR at $55/share: 7.3% (Base Case optimistic)
✗ All scenarios fail 20% PE target by 13-28 percentage points
✗ PE would need 27% discount ($40/share) to hit returns
✓ Nippon can pay $55 and create $20/share of value

#### 2. Risk: LBO Structure Creates Bankruptcy Vulnerability

✗ Base Case already in covenant default (6.08x leverage)
✗ Mild downturn → Cannot service debt (0.97x coverage)
✗ Historical crisis → Immediate bankruptcy (67-136x leverage)
✓ Nippon's equity funding → Zero bankruptcy risk

#### 3. Growth: NSA CapEx Unfundable Under LBO

✗ Annual growth CapEx need: $1.2B
✗ LBO free cash flow: -$64M (negative)
✗ Debt covenants block additional borrowing
✓ Nippon commits full $14B with no covenant restrictions

#### 4. Strategy: Nippon is the Natural Buyer

✗ PE focused on 5-year exit and cost cuts
✗ PE cannot provide permanent capital for cyclical industry
✗ PE adversarial on labor/political issues
✓ Nippon provides strategic partnership, not financial engineering

### The $55 Offer in Context

The offer represents:

| Comparison | Value | Interpretation |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| vs. PE Maximum Price | $55 vs. $40 | **38% premium** |
| vs. USS Standalone | $55 vs. $50 | **10% premium** |
| vs. Nippon Intrinsic Value | $55 vs. $75 | **27% discount** |

**Fair Deal Zone:** $50-75/share
**Nippon Offer:** $55/share ✓ (within fair zone)
**PE Alternative:** $40/share ✗ (below fair zone)

### Strategic Recommendation

The LBO analysis provides **conclusive evidence** that:

1. **No PE alternative exists** at or near $55/share
2. **LBO structure creates unacceptable risk** for USS stakeholders
3. **Nippon's strategic value creation** far exceeds financial engineering
4. **The $55 offer is economically rational** for both parties

**Recommendation:** The merger creates significantly more value than USS could achieve independently or through financial buyer acquisition. USS shareholders should approve the transaction.

### B. Historical Steel Crisis Context

**2015-2016 Steel Crisis:**
- Global overcapacity: 700M tonnes
- Chinese steel exports doubled
- U.S. HRC prices fell 44% ($647 → $362/ton)
- Industry EBITDA margins: 16% → 8%
- USS established full tax valuation allowance (distress indicator)
- Multiple bankruptcies: Essar Steel, ThyssenKrupp facilities

**2008-2009 Financial Crisis:**
- Steel demand fell 35% globally
- U.S. capacity utilization: 90% → 33%
- HRC prices fell 62% ($1,000 → $380/ton)
- ArcelorMittal: $3.6B profit → $1.5B loss (one quarter)
- U.S. Steel stock declined 69%, mass layoffs
- Industry-wide restructuring and plant closures

**Key Insight:** Steel cycles are severe and unpredictable. Leverage amplifies downside risk exponentially.

*This analysis demonstrates that Nippon Steel's $55/share all-equity acquisition is vastly superior to any leveraged buyout alternative, both from a returns perspective (PE cannot generate adequate returns) and a risk perspective (LBO structure creates bankruptcy vulnerability). The offer represents a fair premium to USS shareholders while enabling strategic value creation that no financial buyer could match.*
