# NSA COMMITMENT SUMMARY
# Total_NSA_Investment_Required,14000,,NSA Filing,,"Sum of all 6 projects should equal $14B"
# Incremental_EBITDA_Target,2500,,NSA Filing,,"NSA committed to $2.5B incremental EBITDA by 2035"
# Timeline,2024-2035,,NSA Filing,,"No plant closures through 2035 per NSA"
# Enforcement_Mechanism,,,NSA Filing,,"Golden Share provisions"

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Fill Source columns with data from NSA filing, investor presentations, or press releases
# 2. CapEx in $ millions, Capacity in tons (NOT thousands of tons)
# 3. Source_Document: e.g., "NSA Filing Dec 2023", "USS Investor Presentation Q4 2023"
# 4. CapEx_Variance_Pct: (Source_Total_CapEx - Model_Total_CapEx) / Model_Total_CapEx
# 5. Status: OK (< 10% variance), REVIEW (10-20%), FLAG (> 20%)
# 6. Notes: Explain differences, note if costs are preliminary estimates

# VALIDATION CHECKS:
# 1. Sum of all project CapEx should be ~$9.4B in model (without BR2 ~$7.2B)
# 2. BR2 is already committed/funded, included in all scenarios
# 3. Other 5 projects are "NSA Mandated" - only in that scenario
# 4. Total NSA commitment from filing should be $14B (may include items not in model)

# KNOWN DIFFERENCES:
# - Model may not include working capital requirements
# - Model may not include some minor ancillary projects
# - Timing differences can affect NPV calculations

# ACCEPTABLE VARIANCE:
# - ± 10% on CapEx is acceptable (projects are estimates)
# - ± 20% on EBITDA is acceptable (long-term projections uncertain)
# - Capacity additions should match exactly if disclosed
