# USS Standalone Analysis: What If The Merger Doesn't Happen?

## Slide 1: The Valuation Gap

### USS Standalone Value vs $55 Offer

| Scenario | Share Price | vs $55 Offer | Discount |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Base Case | $50.14 | -$4.86 | 9% |
| Management Outlook | $37.53 | -$17.47 | 32% |
| Conservative | $25.08 | -$29.92 | 54% |

Key Point: Even under the most optimistic standalone scenario, USS trades at a discount to the $55 offer.

## Slide 2: Limited Free Cash Flow Generation

### 10-Year FCF Outlook (2024-2033)

| Metric | Base Case | Management | Conservative |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Total 10Y FCF | $12.7B | $9.6B | $7.1B |
| Average Annual FCF | $1.3B | $962M | $710M |
| 2024 FCF | -$790M | -$910M | -$1.3B |
| 2033 FCF | $1.8B | $1.3B | $1.2B |

Key Point: 2024 shows negative FCF across all scenarios due to BR2 investment. Limited cash generation constrains future investments.

## Slide 3: Capital Allocation Constraints

### What USS Can Fund Alone

| Available Capital | Base Case | Management | Conservative |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 10Y FCF Generation | $12.7B | $9.6B | $7.1B |
| Maintenance CapEx Required | $8.3B | $7.7B | $7.5B |
| Excess for Growth | $4.4B | $1.9B | -$0.4B |

### Projects That Cannot Be Funded Without Merger

| Project | Investment | Status Without Merger |
|---------|------------|----------------------|
| Gary Works BF Revamp | $3.1B | Unfunded |
| Mon Valley HSM | $1.0B | Unfunded |
| Greenfield Mini Mill | $1.0B | Unfunded |
| Keetac/Minntac Mining | $0.8B | Unfunded |
| Fairfield Works | $0.5B | Unfunded |
| Total Unfunded | $6.4B | Cannot proceed |

Key Point: USS can only fund BR2 Mini Mill ($3B) internally. The remaining $6.4B in growth projects require external capital.

---

## Slide 4: Financing Constraints (Critical Insight)

### What Happens If USS Tries to Fund NSA Projects Alone?

Even if USS attempted to execute the NSA investment program ($14B) without Nippon, the financing costs would destroy more value than the investments create.

### Financing Required

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Incremental CapEx (beyond BR2) | $6,400M |
| Cumulative Cash Shortfall | $3,493M |
| New Debt Required (50%) | $1,747M |
| New Equity Required (50%) | $1,747M |

### Shareholder Dilution

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Shares Outstanding | 225M |
| New Shares Issued | 40M |
| Total Shares Post-Dilution | 265M |
| **Equity Dilution** | **17.8%** |

### Cost of Capital Impact

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base USS WACC | 10.5% |
| WACC Adjustment (higher leverage) | +0.25% |
| Adjusted WACC | 10.75% |
| Annual Interest Expense | $49M |

### Value Destruction

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| USS Value (no financing costs) | $69.21/share |
| USS Value (with financing costs) | $48.66/share |
| **Value Destroyed by Financing** | **$20.55/share** |
| Total Value Destroyed | ~$4.6 billion |

**Key Point:** The USS standalone value with all NSA projects ($48.66) is actually **LOWER** than the Base Case without NSA projects ($50.14). This proves USS cannot create value from these investments alone - the merger is necessary because Nippon can fund these projects without financing penalties.

## Slide 5: Structural Challenges

### Segment Performance (10Y FCF Contribution)

| Segment | Base Case | Management | Conservative | Trend |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Mini Mill | $5.5B (43%) | $4.8B (50%) | $4.2B (60%) | Growing |
| Flat-Rolled | $3.8B (30%) | $2.1B (22%) | $1.4B (19%) | Declining |
| USSE | $2.3B (18%) | $1.7B (18%) | $1.0B (14%) | Stable |
| Tubular | $1.1B (9%) | $1.0B (10%) | $0.5B (7%) | Cyclical |

### Operating Margins Under Pressure

| Metric | Base Case | Management | Conservative |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Avg EBITDA Margin | 15.5% | 14.0% | 12.3% |
| Revenue CAGR | 1.0% | 0.2% | 1.4% |

Key Point: Mini Mill is the only growth engine. Flat-Rolled integrated mills face structural decline without $4B+ in modernization investment.

## Slide 6: Strategic Vulnerabilities Without Merger

### What USS Loses By Rejecting the Deal

| Capability | With Merger | Without Merger |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Capital for Investment | $14B committed | Limited to internal FCF |
| Technology Transfer | Access to 30,000 patents | None |
| R&D Budget | $500M/year shared | Current levels only |
| Cost of Capital | 7.5% (IRP-adjusted) | 10.9% (standalone) |
| Global Scale | 86M tonnes (#4 global) | 20M tonnes (regional) |
| Management | U.S. CEO + Nippon expertise | Current team only |

### Competitive Position

- Chinese overcapacity: 1.1 billion tonnes vs 86M tonnes combined
- Import protection: 50% tariffs help but don't solve scale disadvantage
- Technology gap: EAF transition requires capital USS doesn't have alone

## Slide 7: The Bottom Line

### Value Destruction From Rejecting the Merger

| Scenario | Standalone Value | Merger Value | Value Lost |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Base Case | $50.14/share | $55/share | $4.86/share |
| Management | $37.53/share | $55/share | $17.47/share |
| Conservative | $25.08/share | $55/share | $29.92/share |

### For 225M Shares Outstanding

| Scenario | Total Value Destroyed |
|----------|----------------------|
| Base Case | $1.1 billion |
| Management | $3.9 billion |
| Conservative | $6.7 billion |

---

## Slide 8: Summary - Why The Merger Makes Sense

### Without Merger (USS Standalone)

- Share value: $25-50 (below $55 offer)
- Only BR2 can be funded internally
- Flat-Rolled segment continues to decline
- No technology or R&D partnership
- Higher cost of capital (10.9% WACC)
- Vulnerable to global competition
- **Executing NSA projects alone destroys $4.6B in shareholder value**

### With Merger (Nippon Investment)

- Guaranteed $55/share for shareholders
- $14B investment in U.S. facilities
- All 6 major projects funded **without financing penalties**
- Access to Nippon technology and R&D
- Lower cost of capital (7.5% IRP WACC)
- #4 global steelmaker with scale advantages

### Conclusion

Rejecting the merger destroys $1-7 billion in shareholder value while leaving USS strategically disadvantaged in a consolidating global steel industry.

**Critical Insight:** Even attempting to execute the NSA investment program standalone would destroy $4.6B in shareholder value due to financing costs. The USS - No Sale value with all NSA projects ($48.66) is lower than the Base Case ($50.14), proving that the merger creates value specifically because Nippon can fund these investments without penalty.
