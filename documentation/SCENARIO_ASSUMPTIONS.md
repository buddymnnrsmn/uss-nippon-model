## 1. Base Case

### Description
Mid-cycle pricing with modest growth and limited investment capacity. Represents a realistic standalone outlook with only committed capital projects.

### Narrative
USS operates at normalized steel prices (5% below 2023 peaks), with gradual Flat-Rolled decline offset by Mini Mill growth. Only the committed BR2 expansion proceeds. FCF generation is adequate but insufficient for transformative investments.

### Price Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| HRC US Factor | 95% | Mid-cycle normalization from 2023 |
| CRC US Factor | 95% | Tracks HRC |
| Coated US Factor | 95% | Tracks HRC |
| HRC EU Factor | 92% | European weakness |
| OCTG Factor | 95% | Energy sector normalization |
| Annual Price Growth | 0.5% | Barely keeps pace with inflation |
| Implied 2024 HRC | $646/ton | vs $680 benchmark |

### Capital Projects

| Project | Included | Investment |
|---------|----------|------------|
| BR2 Mini Mill | Yes | $3.0B |
| All Others | No | - |

---

## 2. Conservative

### Description
Downside protection scenario with weak steel markets, reduced volumes, and higher discount rate.

### Narrative
Steel prices decline 15% from 2023 due to weak demand and Chinese overcapacity. Volumes contract across all segments. Higher WACC reflects increased risk premium in challenging market.

### Price Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| HRC US Factor | 85% | 15% decline from 2023 |
| CRC US Factor | 85% | Tracks HRC |

## 4. Management

### Description
December 2023 projections used in the merger proxy. Represents management's view of standalone operations.

### Narrative
Management projected $700/ton HRC pricing (conservative vs actuals), with footprint reduction over time. Flat-Rolled declines as blast furnaces close, offset by Mini Mill growth. EBITDA of $2.4-3.1B and FCF of $1.6-1.9B annually.

### Price Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| HRC US Factor | 92% | $750/ton 2024, $700/ton 2025+ |
| CRC US Factor | 92% | Tracks HRC |
| Coated US Factor | 92% | Tracks HRC |
| HRC EU Factor | 90% | European pricing |
| OCTG Factor | 95% | Energy sector |

| Terminal Growth | 1.0% | Mature/declining |
| Exit Multiple | 5.0x | Slightly above average |
| IRP-Adjusted WACC | 7.55% | Standard IRP |

### Capital Projects

| Project | Included | Investment |
|---------|----------|------------|
| BR2 Mini Mill | Yes | $3.0B |
| All Others | No | - |

### Management Projections (December 2023)

| Year | Revenue | EBITDA | FCF |
|------|---------|--------|-----|
| 2024 | $17.7B | $2.4B | $1.6B |
| 2025 | $15.8B | $2.7B | $1.7B |
| 2026 | $14.5B | $2.9B | $1.8B |
| 2027 | $13.8B | $3.0B | $1.8B |

## 5. NSA Mandated CapEx

### Description
Full NSA investment program with $14B in capital projects and operational synergies.

### Narrative
Nippon executes the complete investment program: Gary Works BF revamp, Mon Valley HSM, Greenfield Mini Mill, mining investments, and Fairfield modernization. No plant closures through 2035. Incremental EBITDA target of $2.5B annually.

### USS Standalone Financing Impact

**Important:** If USS tried to execute this investment program without Nippon, they would face significant financing costs:

| Financing Impact | Amount |
|------------------|--------|
| Incremental CapEx (beyond BR2) | $6,400M |
| Cash Shortfall to Finance | $3,493M |
| Required Debt (50%) | $1,747M |
| Required Equity (50%) | $1,747M |
| Equity Dilution | 17.8% (40M new shares) |
| WACC Increase | +0.25% |

**Result:** USS - No Sale value drops from $69.21 to **$48.66** after financing costs. This is lower than the Base Case ($50.14), meaning the investments would destroy value for USS shareholders without Nippon's balance sheet support.

### Price Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| HRC US Factor | 95% | Same as Base Case |
| CRC US Factor | 95% | Tracks HRC |
| Coated US Factor | 95% | Tracks HRC |
| HRC EU Factor | 92% | European pricing |
| OCTG Factor | 95% | Energy sector |
| Annual Price Growth | 1.0% | Capacity discipline benefit |
| Implied 2024 HRC | $646/ton | Mid-cycle |

### Volume Assumptions

| Segment | Volume Factor | Growth Adj | Net Effect |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|
| Flat-Rolled | 100% | 0.0% | No closures (NSA) |
| Mini Mill | 105% | +2.0% | New capacity |
| USSE | 100% | 0.0% | Stable |
| Tubular | 100% | +0.5% | Modest growth |

### Valuation Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| USS WACC | 10.5% | Nippon backing benefit |
| Terminal Growth | 1.5% | Investment-driven growth |
| Exit Multiple | 5.0x | Improved outlook |
| IRP-Adjusted WACC | 7.55% | Standard IRP |

### Capital Projects

| Project | Included | Investment | 2033 EBITDA |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| BR2 Mini Mill | Yes | $3.0B | $560M |
| Gary Works BF | Yes | $3.1B | $402M |
| Mon Valley HSM | Yes | $1.0B | $130M |
| Greenfield Mini Mill | Yes | $1.0B | $274M |
| Mining Investment | Yes | $0.8B | $80M |
| Fairfield Works | Yes | $0.5B | $60M |
| **Total** | **6** | **$9.4B** | **$1,506M** |

Note: Total investment is $9.4B in model; remaining $4.6B includes Basic Labor Agreement ($1.4B), working capital, and contingencies to reach $14B NSA commitment.

### NSA Constraints Applied

| Constraint | Impact on Model |
|------------|-----------------|
| No plant closures through 2035 | Flat-Rolled maintained at 100% |
| No layoffs | Labor costs unchanged |
| 27,000-28,000 jobs guaranteed | Volume maintained |
| U.S. CEO and board | Governance only |
| Golden Share veto | Flexibility limited |
