# USS / Nippon Steel Merger: Scenario Assumptions

## Overview

This document details the key assumptions underlying each valuation scenario. All price factors are expressed relative to **through-cycle equilibrium baselines** (not 2023 spot prices). Scenarios are calibrated to historical data (1990-2023) to reflect the full range of outcomes USS has experienced.

**Through-Cycle Baselines (Updated February 2026):**

| Product | Through-Cycle Price | Derivation | 2023 Avg | Factor at 2023 |
|---------|--------------------:|------------|----------|----------------|
| HRC US | $738/ton | Avg(Pre-COVID $625, Post-Spike $850) | $916 | 1.24x |
| CRC US | $994/ton | Avg(Pre-COVID $820, Post-Spike $1,130) | $1,127 | 1.13x |
| Coated US | $1,113/ton | Avg(Pre-COVID $920, Post-Spike $1,266) | $1,263 | 1.13x |
| HRC EU | $611/ton | Avg(Pre-COVID $512, Post-Spike $710) | $717 | 1.17x |
| OCTG US | $2,388/ton | Avg(Pre-COVID $1,350, Post-Spike $3,228) | $2,750 | 1.15x |

A factor of **1.0x = through-cycle normal**. The 2023 Bloomberg averages were ~1.13-1.24x (above trend).

**Historical Calibration (Probability Weights):**
- Severe Downturn: 0-25th percentile (historical frequency: 24%) → **25% weight**
- Downside: 25-40th percentile (historical frequency: 30%) → **30% weight**
- Base Case: 50th percentile - median (historical frequency: 30%) → **30% weight**
- Above Average: 75-90th percentile (historical frequency: 10%) → **10% weight**
- Optimistic: 90th+ percentile (historical frequency: 5%) → **5% weight**

**Margin Sensitivity (Recalibrated February 2026):**

| Segment | Margin Sensitivity | EBITDA Margin Cap |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Flat Rolled | 2% per $100 HRC move | 22% |
| Mini Mill | 2.5% per $100 HRC move | 22% |
| USSE | 2% per $100 HRC move | 22% |
| Tubular | 1% per $100 HRC move | 22% |

## Scenario Summary (Recalibrated February 2026)

| Scenario | USS Value | Nippon Value | vs $55 | Probability |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Severe Downturn | $0.00 | $1.94 | -$53.06 | 25% |
| Downside | $30.68 | $43.77 | -$11.23 | 30% |
| Base Case (Mid-Cycle) | $56.86 | $79.05 | +$24.05 | 30% |
| Above Average | $84.98 | $116.05 | +$61.05 | 10% |
| Optimistic | $101.67 | $140.12 | +$85.12 | 5% |
| Wall Street | — | — | — | Reference |
| NSA Mandated CapEx | — | — | — | Reference |

**Probability-Weighted Expected Value:**
- Expected USS Standalone: **$39.84/share**
- Expected Nippon Value: **$55.94/share**
- Nippon Offer: **$55.00/share**

These weighted averages closely match USS pre-deal trading (~$39) and the deal price ($55).

## 8. Futures-Based Scenarios

These scenarios use Bloomberg spot/futures data as of January 2026, with through-cycle baselines.

### Futures Scenario Summary

| Scenario | HRC Factor | Implied HRC | USS Value | Nippon Value | Prob |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Futures: Downside | 0.98x | $723 | $36.73 | $50.78 | 15% |
| Futures: Base Case | 1.20x | $886 | $83.81 | $114.47 | 40% |
| Futures: Above Average | 1.41x | $1,041 | $121.41 | $164.56 | 30% |
| Futures: Optimistic | 1.71x | $1,263 | $189.25 | $260.78 | 15% |
| Futures: No Tariff | 1.12x | $827 | $45.06 | $63.55 | Ref |

**Note:** Futures scenarios reflect current tariff-supported pricing. The TTM Bloomberg average (HRC $883, factor 1.20x) aligns with the Futures Base Case.

---

## 9. Tariff Scenarios (Section 232)

The model includes explicit tariff rate sensitivity. The tariff adjustment is **neutral at 25%** (returns factor 1.0).

### Tariff Impact on Prices

| Tariff Rate | HRC Adjustment | EU Adjustment | OCTG Adjustment |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0% (removed) | 0.85x | 0.955x | 0.91x |
| 10% (reduced) | 0.91x | 0.973x | 0.95x |
| 25% (current) | 1.00x | 1.00x | 1.00x |
| 50% (escalation) | 1.15x | 1.045x | 1.09x |

**Conservative HRC uplift:** 15% at 25% tariff (between OLS 7% and empirical 18%)

### Monte Carlo Tariff Variables

| Variable | Distribution | Parameters | Mean |
|----------|-------------|------------|------|
| tariff_probability | Beta(8,2) | [0.0, 1.0] | 80% maintained |
| tariff_rate_if_changed | Triangular | [0%, 10%, 25%] | ~12% |

Continuous blending: `effective_rate = prob × 0.25 + (1-prob) × alt_rate`

Tariff risk adds ~4pp downside probability vs no-tariff baseline.

## Monte Carlo vs Scenarios

The probability-weighted scenario average and Monte Carlo simulation answer different questions:

| Method | USS | Nippon | What It Answers |
|--------|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Wtd Avg (5 scenarios) | $39.84 | $55.94 | Market-implied value (matches trading) |
| MC Mean (25 vars) | $61.2 | $85.0 | Statistical expected value |
| MC Median | $57.3 | $79.8 | Most likely single outcome |
| Base Case (deterministic) | $39.04 | $55.66 | Through-cycle mid-point |

The scenario WA is lower than MC because it assigns 25% to severe downturn (equity near zero), which is more frequent than the MC's continuous distribution implies. The scenario weights were deliberately calibrated to match pre-deal market pricing.

**Top MC sensitivity drivers** (by correlation to share price):
1. HRC Price Factor (ρ=0.66)
2. Coated Price Factor (ρ=0.58)
3. CRC Price Factor (ρ=0.53)
4. Annual Price Growth (ρ=0.38)
5. Flat Rolled Volume (ρ=0.23)
