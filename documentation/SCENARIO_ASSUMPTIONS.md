## 1. Severe Downturn (Historical Crisis)

### Description
Recession scenario modeling 2009, 2015, and 2020-type crisis conditions. Represents the 0-25th percentile of historical outcomes.

### Narrative
Severe demand collapse driven by recession, automotive production down 20-30%, construction spending decline 15-25%, oil & gas CAPEX crash. Import surge as domestic prices fall. EBITDA margins near zero or negative as fixed costs cannot flex. All discretionary CapEx suspended.

### Historical Precedent
- **2008-09 Financial Crisis:** Revenue -53%, EBITDA -$1,406M, Net Income -$1,406M (2 years)
- **2015-16 Import Surge:** Revenue -34%, EBITDA $19M (0.2% margin), Net Income -$1,642M (2 years)
- **2020 COVID Shock:** Revenue -25%, EBITDA -$69M, Net Income -$1,165M (1 year)
- **Historical Frequency:** 8-9 years out of 34 (24%)

### Price Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| HRC US Factor | 68% | -32% from benchmark (2009/2015 levels) |
| CRC US Factor | 68% | Tracks HRC |
| Coated US Factor | 70% | Slight premium to HRC |
| HRC EU Factor | 65% | EU hit harder in recessions |
| OCTG Factor | 50% | Oil crash correlation |
| Annual Price Growth | -2.0% | Deflation during crisis |
| Implied 2024 HRC | $462/ton | Historical recession range $450-500 |

### Volume Assumptions

| Segment | Volume Factor | Growth Adj | Net Effect |
|---------|---------------|------------|------------|
| Flat-Rolled | 80% | -3.0% | -20% demand collapse |
| Mini Mill | 85% | -2.0% | More resilient (-15%) |
| USSE | 75% | -4.0% | EU exposure (-25%) |
| Tubular | 70% | -5.0% | Oil correlation (-30%) |

**Rationale:**
- Automotive production -20 to -30% (2009, 2020 precedent)
- Construction spending -15 to -25%
- Oil & gas CAPEX collapse (tubular worst hit)
- Import surge as domestic prices fall

### Valuation Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| USS WACC | 13.5% | Distress premium (+350bps) |
| Terminal Growth | 0.5% | Minimal/declining growth |
| Exit Multiple | 3.5x | Distressed valuation |
| IRP-Adjusted WACC | 9.25% | Nippon also affected |

### Financial Impact

**Estimated EBITDA:** $0 - $500M (0-3% margin)

**Historical Comparison:**
- 2009: $520M EBITDA (but negative net income after interest)
- 2015: $19M EBITDA (0.2% margin)
- 2020: -$69M EBITDA (negative margin)

### Capital Projects

| Project | Included | Investment |
|---------|----------|------------|
| All Projects | No | Suspended |

**Rationale:** In severe downturn, all discretionary CapEx is suspended. Only critical maintenance spending continues. BR2 Phase 2 would be delayed or cancelled.

### Key Risks in This Scenario

1. **Covenant Breach:** Debt/EBITDA could exceed 15x if EBITDA drops to $250M
2. **Negative FCF:** Working capital releases don't offset EBITDA collapse
3. **Equity Dilution:** May require capital raise to maintain liquidity
4. **Project Cancellations:** All growth CapEx halted
5. **Credit Downgrade:** Below investment grade, refinancing risk

---

## 2. Downside (Weak Markets)

### Description
Below-average cycle with soft demand and import pressure. Represents the 25-40th percentile of historical outcomes.

### Narrative
Steel prices decline 15% from 2023 due to weak demand and Chinese overcapacity. Volumes contract across all segments. Higher WACC reflects increased risk premium in challenging market.

### Narrative
USS operates at normalized steel prices (5% below 2023 peaks), with gradual Flat-Rolled decline offset by Mini Mill growth. Only the committed BR2 expansion proceeds. FCF generation is adequate but insufficient for transformative investments.

## 6. Optimistic (Peak Cycle)

### Description
2021-2022 boom conditions with peak pricing and margins. Represents the 90th+ percentile of historical outcomes.

### Narrative
Strong pricing environment based on management's December 2023 projections ($700/ton HRC), with footprint reduction over time. Flat-Rolled declines as blast furnaces close, offset by Mini Mill growth. EBITDA of $2.4-3.1B and FCF of $1.6-1.9B annually.

### Price Assumptions

## 7. NSA Mandated CapEx

### Description
Full NSA investment program with $14B in capital projects and operational synergies.

### Narrative
Nippon executes the complete investment program: Gary Works BF revamp, Mon Valley HSM, Greenfield Mini Mill, mining investments, and Fairfield modernization. No plant closures through 2035. Incremental EBITDA target of $2.5B annually.

### USS Standalone Financing Impact

**Important:** If USS tried to execute this investment program without Nippon, they would face significant financing costs:

| Financing Impact | Amount |
|------------------|--------|
| Incremental CapEx (beyond BR2) | $6,400M |
| Cash Shortfall to Finance | $3,493M |
| Required Debt (50%) | $1,747M |
| Required Equity (50%) | $1,747M |
| Equity Dilution | 17.8% (40M new shares) |
| WACC Increase | +0.25% |

**Result:** USS - No Sale value drops from $69.21 to **$48.66** after financing costs. This is lower than the Base Case ($50.14), meaning the investments would destroy value for USS shareholders without Nippon's balance sheet support.

### Price Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |

|-----------|-------|-----------|
| USS WACC | 10.5% | Nippon backing benefit |
| Terminal Growth | 1.5% | Investment-driven growth |
| Exit Multiple | 5.0x | Improved outlook |
| IRP-Adjusted WACC | 7.55% | Standard IRP |

### Capital Projects

| Project | Included | Investment | 2033 EBITDA |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|

## 8. Probability-Weighted Valuation Framework

### Overview

The probability-weighted valuation calculates an **expected value** by weighting each scenario by its historical frequency. This approach better captures the full range of potential outcomes compared to relying on a single "base case" scenario.

### Methodology

**Expected Value = Σ (Scenario Value × Probability)**

### Probability Weights

| Scenario | Probability | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Severe Downturn | 25% | 8-9 years out of 34 (1990-2023) |
| Downside | 30% | Below-average but not crisis |
| Base Case | 30% | Mid-cycle median performance |
| Above Average | 10% | Strong cycle like 2017-18 |
| Optimistic | 5% | Peak cycle like 2021-22 |
| **Total** | **100%** | |

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected USS Standalone Value** | **$23.91/share** |
| Expected Nippon Value | $38.67/share |
| Nippon Offer | $55.00/share |
| **Premium to Risk-Adjusted Value** | **+130%** |

### Interpretation

The probability-weighted analysis shows:

1. **$55 offer is highly attractive:** 130% premium over expected standalone value when accounting for all scenarios including severe downturn risk

2. **Downside protection is critical:** Without weighting for the 25% probability of severe downturn ($5.15/share value), shareholders underestimate the risk of remaining standalone

3. **Optimistic scenarios are rare:** Only 15% probability of outcomes where USS standalone value exceeds $50/share (Above Average + Optimistic)

4. **Expected value reflects reality:** $23.91/share weighted average better represents USS's risk-adjusted fair value than any single scenario

---

## 9. Historical Calibration & Validation

### Percentile Mapping

Scenarios are calibrated to historical performance percentiles (1990-2023):

| Scenario | Historical Percentile | Years Represented |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Severe Downturn | 0-25th | 2009, 2015, 2020, 1991, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2016 |
| Downside | 25-40th | 2004, 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2019, 2023 |
| Base Case | 50th (median) | 1994, 1995, 1997, 2006, 2007, 2017, 2024 |
| Above Average | 75-90th | 1993, 1998, 2000, 2014, 2018 |
| Optimistic | 90th+ | 1990, 2008, 2021, 2022 |

### Historical Frequency

**Severe Downturns (24% of years):**
- 2009: Revenue -53%, EBITDA -$1,406M
- 2015: Revenue -34%, EBITDA $19M (0.2% margin)
- 2020: Revenue -25%, EBITDA -$69M
- Plus 5-6 other weak years (1991, 2001-2003, 2016)

**Key Insight:** USS has experienced severe downturns or weak markets roughly 55% of years historically (24% severe + 30% downside). Using only "base case" or better scenarios ignores more than half the historical outcomes.

### Validation Against History

See MODEL_VALIDATION_HISTORICAL_CORRELATION.md for detailed validation showing:
- Current "Base Case" (0.95x pricing) was at 91st percentile historically
- Current "Conservative" (0.85x pricing) was at 82nd percentile historically
- New calibration aligns scenarios with actual percentiles
- Probability weights match historical frequency distribution

## Key Differentiators by Scenario

### What Makes Each Scenario Unique

| Scenario | Primary Differentiator | Historical Percentile |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Severe Downturn | Crisis conditions: -32% prices, -20% volumes, 13.5% WACC | 0-25th |
| Downside | Weak markets: -15% prices, 12% WACC, volume contraction | 25-40th |
| Base Case | Mid-cycle: -12% prices, 10.9% WACC, historical median | 50th |
| Above Average | Strong cycle: -5% prices, 10.9% WACC, BR2 only | 75-90th |
| Optimistic | Peak cycle: mgmt pricing, footprint reduction | 90th+ |
| Wall Street | Analyst WACC (12.5%), flat prices, reference only | - |
| Nippon | 6 projects, $14B investment, no closures, reference only | - |

### Scenario Selection Guide

| Use This Scenario | When Analyzing |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Severe Downturn | Stress test, downside risk, recession scenario |
| Downside | Below-average market conditions |
| Base Case | Most likely single outcome (50th percentile) |
| Above Average | Strong market environment |
| Optimistic | Upside case, peak cycle |
| **Probability-Weighted** | **Risk-adjusted fair value (RECOMMENDED)** |
| Wall Street | Third-party validation |
| Nippon Commitments | Full merger benefits |
