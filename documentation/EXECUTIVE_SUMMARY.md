|----------|---------------|----------------------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| Base Case | $50.14 | $74.87 | +$19.87 | $12.7B | 15.5% |
| Conservative | $25.08 | $42.74 | -$12.26 | $7.1B | 12.3% |

| NSA Mandated CapEx | $48.66* | $109.88 | +$54.88 | $14.1B | 19.6% |

*USS - No Sale value includes financing costs (debt + equity dilution). See "USS Standalone Financing Impact" below.

### Key Observations

1. The $55 Offer Falls Within a Reasonable Range
   - USS standalone value: $25-69/share across scenarios
   - Nippon's IRP-adjusted view: $44-110/share
   - Management/Wall Street cases ($33-57) bracket the offer price

2. Interest Rate Parity Creates WACC Arbitrage
   - Nippon's JPY WACC: 3.94%
   - IRP-adjusted USD WACC: 7.55%
   - USS standalone WACC: 10.9%
   - WACC advantage: 3.35 percentage points
   - This lower discount rate adds ~$25/share to Nippon's valuation

3. NSA Investment Program Adds Meaningful Value
   - $14 billion committed capital adds ~$35-55/share vs base case
   - Requires successful execution across 6 major capital projects
   - Incremental EBITDA target: $2.5 billion annually

## Segment Analysis

### 10-Year FCF Contribution by Segment (Base Case)

| Segment | 10Y FCF | % of Total | Key Driver |
|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| Mini Mill | $5,487M | 43.1% | BRS expansion, low-cost EAF production |
| Flat-Rolled | $3,791M | 29.8% | Integrated operations, gradual decline |
| USSE | $2,337M | 18.4% | European flat-rolled, stable demand |
| Tubular | $1,110M | 8.7% | OCTG for energy sector |

### Strategic Implications

- Mini Mill dominance: EAF operations generate 43% of FCF despite smaller revenue base
- Flat-Rolled challenges: Integrated mills face structural headwinds without investment
- Geographic diversification: USSE provides European market stability
- Energy exposure: Tubular tied to oil and gas drilling cycles

## NSA Investment Program

### Capital Commitments ($14 Billion Total)

| Project | Investment | Segment | Strategic Rationale |
|---------|------------|---------|---------------------|
| Gary Works BF | $3.1B | Flat-Rolled | Extend BF#14 life 20 years |
| Big River Steel 2 | $3.0B | Mini Mill | 3M tons/year EAF capacity |
| Basic Labor Agreement | $1.4B | All | USW facility investments |
| Greenfield Mini Mill | $1.0B | Mini Mill | New EAF capacity |
| Mon Valley HSM | $1.0B | Flat-Rolled | Hot strip mill replacement |
| Keetac/Minntac Mining | $0.8B | Flat-Rolled | Iron ore supply security |
| Fairfield Works | $0.5B | Flat-Rolled | Southern mill modernization |

### NSA Constraints

- No plant closures through 2035
- No layoffs resulting from transaction
- 27,000-28,000 jobs guaranteed
- U.S. government "Golden Share" veto authority
- American CEO and majority U.S. citizen board required

### Value Creation

The NSA Mandated CapEx scenario shows:

| Metric | With NSA Investment | Base Case | Difference |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| Value to Nippon | $109.88/share | $74.87 | +$35/share |
| USS - No Sale | $48.66/share* | $50.14 | -$1.48/share |
| 10Y FCF | $14.1B | $12.7B | +$1.4B |

*Includes financing costs - see below.

## USS Standalone Financing Impact

### Why USS Cannot Execute the NSA Program Alone

A critical insight: **USS cannot realistically fund $14B in capital projects** from operating cash flow. If USS tried to execute the NSA investment program without Nippon, they would face significant financing costs:

| Financing Impact | Amount |
|------------------|--------|
| Incremental CapEx (beyond BR2) | $6,400M |
| Cumulative Cash Shortfall | $3,493M |
| New Debt Required (50%) | $1,747M |
| New Equity Required (50%) | $1,747M |

### Shareholder Dilution

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Current Shares | 225M |
| New Shares Issued | 40M |
| **Total Shares** | **265M** |
| **Dilution** | **17.8%** |

### Cost of Capital Impact

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base USS WACC | 10.5% |
| WACC Adjustment (higher leverage) | +0.25% |
| **Adjusted WACC** | **10.75%** |
| Annual Interest Expense | $49M |

### Value Destruction from Financing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| USS Value (no financing costs) | $69.21/share |
| USS Value (with financing costs) | $48.66/share |
| **Value Destroyed** | **$20.55/share** |
| Total Value Destroyed | ~$4.6 billion |

### Key Insight

Even if USS tried to execute the NSA investment program standalone, the financing costs would **destroy more value than the investments create**. The USS - No Sale value with all NSA projects ($48.66) is actually **lower** than the Base Case ($50.14).

This is why the merger creates value: **Nippon can fund the investments without these penalties** due to their superior balance sheet capacity.

## Interest Rate Parity Adjustment

### WACC Conversion (JPY to USD)

The IRP formula converts Nippon's JPY-based WACC to a USD-equivalent rate:

```
WACC(USD) = (1 + WACC(JPY)) x (1 + r_USD) / (1 + r_JPY) - 1
WACC(USD) = (1 + 3.94%) x (1 + 4.25%) / (1 + 0.75%) - 1
WACC(USD) = 7.55%
```

### Impact on Valuation

| Perspective | WACC | Base Case Value | Difference |
|-------------|------|-----------------|------------|
| USS Standalone | 10.9% | $50.14 | Baseline |
| Nippon (IRP-adjusted) | 7.55% | $74.87 | +$24.73 (+49%) |

The IRP adjustment reveals that Nippon's true cost of capital advantage is 3.35%, not the naive 7% difference between JPY and USD rates.

## Steel Price Sensitivity

### Pricing Assumptions

| Scenario | HRC Factor | 2024 Realized Price | Annual Growth |
|----------|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Base Case | 95% | ~$980/ton | 0.5% |
| Conservative | 85% | ~$876/ton | 1.0% |
| Management | 92% | ~$948/ton | 0.0% |
| Nippon | 95% | ~$980/ton | 1.0% |

### Valuation Sensitivity

- +10% steel prices: +$15-20/share valuation
- -10% steel prices: -$12-18/share valuation
- Management's $700/ton HRC assumption was conservative vs 2023 actuals (~$814/ton)

---

## Investment Thesis

### Bull Case (Nippon Commitments: $110/share Nippon view)

- Full execution of $14B investment program
- $2.5B incremental EBITDA achieved
- No plant closures preserves integrated capacity
- Mini Mill expansion drives growth
- Synergies from Nippon technology transfer

### Base Case ($75/share Nippon view)

- Mid-cycle steel pricing (5% below 2023)
- Minimal price growth (0.5% annually)
- BR2 Mini Mill project only
- Modest volume decline in Flat-Rolled
- Limited FCF constrains reinvestment

### Bear Case (Conservative: $43/share Nippon view)

- Steel prices decline 15% from 2023
- Demand weakness across segments
- Higher discount rate (12% WACC)
- Only BR2 Mini Mill project proceeds

---

## Conclusions

1. The $55 offer is fair under conservative assumptions
   - Management case: $38-56/share brackets the offer
   - Wall Street case: $34-60/share brackets the offer
   - Investment banks validated this range in fairness opinions

2. Nippon sees more value due to lower cost of capital
   - IRP-adjusted WACC of 7.55% vs 10.9% adds ~$25/share
   - Base case Nippon view: $75/share vs $55 offer = 36% upside

3. NSA investments could unlock significant value
   - Full investment program adds $35-55/share
   - Requires flawless execution of $14B capital deployment
   - "Golden Share" constraints limit strategic flexibility

4. Mini Mills are the value driver
   - 43% of FCF from Mini Mill segment
   - EAF technology provides cost and environmental advantages
   - BR2 and potential Greenfield expansion are critical

5. Steel prices remain the key variable
   - A $100/ton move in HRC pricing swings valuation by ~$15-20/share
   - Management's $700/ton assumption was conservative
   - Current mid-cycle pricing (~$750-800) supports base case

## Model Methodology

### Revenue Derivation

- Price x Volume calculation by segment
- Benchmark prices (HRC, CRC, Coated, OCTG) with segment-specific premiums
- Volume projections based on capacity utilization and growth rates

### FCF Calculation

```
Revenue
  -> EBITDA (margin varies with steel prices)
  -> EBIT (less D&A at 4.5-6% of revenue)
  -> NOPAT (16.9% cash tax rate)
  -> Gross Cash Flow (+ D&A addback)
  -> FCF (less CapEx, +/- Working Capital)
```

### Valuation

- 10-year explicit DCF forecast (2024-2033)
- Terminal value: Blended Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple methods
- Equity bridge: Net debt ($4.2B), pension ($126M), leases ($117M), cash ($3.0B), investments ($761M)
- Shares outstanding: 225 million

### Data Sources

- USS 10-K FY2023 segment disclosures
- Nippon Steel merger proxy (December 2023)
- Barclays and Goldman Sachs fairness opinions
- NSA Investment Program announcements (May 2025)
