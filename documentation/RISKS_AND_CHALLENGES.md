| Metric | Projection | Risk |
|--------|------------|------|
| Total Capital Deployed | $29B ($15B acquisition + $14B investment) | Overpayment risk |
| Projected EBITDA Uplift | $2.5B annually | Execution dependency |
| Implied ROIC | 8.6% on infrastructure CapEx | Below cost of capital at mid-cycle |
| Payback Period | 10-15 years | Long duration, high uncertainty |

### 4.2 Balance Sheet Impact

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Nippon Debt Increase | Significant leverage to fund acquisition |
| USS Pension Obligations | $126M unfunded liability assumed |
| Working Capital | ~$2B tied up in inventory/receivables |
| Contingent Liabilities | Environmental remediation at legacy sites |

### 4.3 Currency Risk

| Exposure | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| JPY/USD Volatility | Nippon reports in JPY; USS generates USD cash flows |
| IRP Assumption | 7.55% USD WACC assumes stable rate differentials |
| Hedging Costs | Long-term currency hedging expensive |

---

## 5. Strategic Risks

### 5.1 Technology Transition

| Risk | Description | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Decarbonization Pressure | Blast furnaces face carbon regulation | 2030-2040 |
| EAF Transition | Industry shifting to electric arc furnaces | Ongoing |
| Green Steel Premium | Uncertain market for low-carbon steel | Emerging |

## 6. Risks of NOT Completing the Merger

### 6.1 USS Standalone Challenges

| Challenge | Without Merger | With Merger |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Capital for Investment | Limited to $1B/year FCF | $14B committed |
| Flat-Rolled Modernization | Cannot fund Gary/Mon Valley | Fully funded |
| Technology Access | Current capabilities only | 30,000 patents |
| Cost of Capital | 10.9% WACC | 7.5% IRP-adjusted |
| Competitive Scale | 20M tonnes (regional) | 86M tonnes (#4 global) |

### 6.2 Shareholder Value Destruction

| Scenario | Standalone Value | vs $55 Offer | Value Lost |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Base Case | $50.14/share | -$4.86 | $1.1B total |
| Management | $37.53/share | -$17.47 | $3.9B total |
| Conservative | $25.08/share | -$29.92 | $6.7B total |

### 6.3 Financing Constraints (Critical Insight)

**If USS tried to execute the NSA investment program ($14B) without Nippon, the financing costs would destroy more value than the investments create.**

| Financing Impact | Amount |
|------------------|--------|
| Incremental CapEx (beyond BR2) | $6,400M |
| Cumulative Cash Shortfall | $3,493M |
| New Debt Required (50%) | $1,747M |
| New Equity Required (50%) | $1,747M |

| Shareholder Dilution | Impact |
|---------------------|--------|
| Current Shares | 225M |
| New Shares Issued | 40M |
| Total Shares Post-Dilution | 265M |
| **Equity Dilution** | **17.8%** |

| Cost of Capital Impact | Value |
|-----------------------|-------|
| Base USS WACC | 10.5% |
| WACC Adjustment (higher leverage) | +0.25% |
| Adjusted WACC | 10.75% |
| Annual Interest Expense | $49M |

**Value Destruction:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| USS Value (no financing costs) | $69.21/share |
| USS Value (with financing costs) | $48.66/share |
| **Value Destroyed** | **$20.55/share** |
| Total Value Destroyed | ~$4.6 billion |

**Key Insight:** The USS standalone value with all NSA projects ($48.66) is actually **lower** than the Base Case ($50.14). This proves USS cannot create value from these investments alone due to financing penalties. The merger creates value because Nippon can fund the investments without these costs.

### 6.4 Strategic Vulnerability

Without merger, USS faces:
- Continued Flat-Rolled decline without investment
- Mini Mill as only growth driver
- No technology partnership
- Higher financing costs
- Potential acquisition by less favorable buyer

## 7. Risk Mitigation Summary

### What the NSA Provides

| Risk Category | Mitigation Mechanism |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Job Security | No layoffs guarantee through 2035 |
| Plant Closures | Golden Share veto on facility closures |
| U.S. Control | American CEO; majority U.S. board |
| Investment Commitment | $14B legally binding; government oversight |
| National Security | Production commitments; technology protections |
| **Financing Constraints** | **Nippon's balance sheet eliminates $4.6B value destruction** |

### What Remains Unmitigated

| Risk | Why Unmitigated |
|------|-----------------|
| Steel Price Volatility | Market-driven; beyond control |
| Execution Risk | Dependent on management capability |
| Technology Transition | Industry-wide disruption |
| Political Changes | Future administration discretion |
| Currency Fluctuations | Macroeconomic factors |

---

## 8. Risk-Adjusted Scenarios

### Probability-Weighted Valuation

| Scenario | Probability | Nippon Value | Weighted Value |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| NSA Mandated CapEx (100% execution) | 20% | $109.88/share | $22 |
| NSA Mandated CapEx (75% execution) | 30% | $101/share | $30 |
| Base Case | 30% | $74.87/share | $22 |
| Conservative | 20% | $42.74/share | $9 |
| **Expected Value** | **100%** | | **$83/share** |

### Implied Risk Premium

- Expected Value: $83/share
- Offer Price: $55/share
- Risk Discount: $28/share (34%)

This suggests the market is pricing significant execution and macro risk into the deal.

## 9. Key Monitoring Metrics

### Leading Indicators to Watch

| Metric | Threshold | Signal |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| HRC Price | Below $600/ton | Margin compression |
| Capacity Utilization | Below 70% | Demand weakness |
| USW Relations | Strike threats | Integration risk |
| Project Milestones | 6+ month delays | Execution problems |
| Automotive Orders | -10% YoY | Demand deterioration |
| Scrap Prices | +20% increase | EAF cost pressure |

### Quarterly Review Items

1. Capital deployment progress vs $14B commitment
2. EBITDA margin trends by segment
3. FCF generation vs projections
4. Labor relations and USW negotiations
5. Regulatory/political developments
6. Steel price and demand trends

## Conclusion

The merger presents a complex risk/reward profile:

**Risks Favor Caution:**
- Aggressive capital deployment timeline
- Steel price volatility exposure
- Golden Share constraints on flexibility
- Long payback period on investments
- Technology transition uncertainty

**Risks Favor Proceeding:**
- USS standalone value below offer price
- Limited alternatives for USS shareholders
- Strategic necessity of scale and technology
- NSA protections for jobs and facilities
- Nippon's execution track record
- **USS cannot fund NSA investments alone without destroying $4.6B in shareholder value**

**Net Assessment:** The risks of NOT completing the merger (shareholder value destruction, strategic decline) outweigh the risks of proceeding, provided Nippon can execute on 70%+ of the investment program benefits.

**Critical Insight:** Even if USS could execute the NSA investment program standalone, the financing costs (17.8% equity dilution, higher WACC) would destroy more value than the investments create. The USS - No Sale value with all NSA projects ($48.66) is lower than the Base Case ($50.14), proving that the merger creates value specifically because Nippon can fund these investments without penalty.
