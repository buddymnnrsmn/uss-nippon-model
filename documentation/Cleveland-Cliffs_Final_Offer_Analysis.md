# Cleveland-Cliffs' Final Offer for U.S. Steel Corporation
## December 15, 2023 Proposal Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (anonymized as "Company D" in U.S. Steel's Schedule 14A proxy statement) submitted its final acquisition proposal on December 15, 2023, offering $54.00 per share in mixed cash and stock consideration. Despite being nominally competitive with Nippon Steel's $55.00 all-cash offer, U.S. Steel's Board of Directors rejected the Cleveland-Cliffs proposal due to significant execution risks, antitrust concerns, and uncertainty regarding actual realizable value.

## Board of Directors' Rejection Rationale

### Primary Reasons for Rejecting Cleveland-Cliffs Despite Competitive Nominal Price

#### 1. Massive Antitrust Execution Risk

**Anticipated Regulatory Challenges:**
- Combined entity would control **100% of U.S. blast furnace production capacity**
- Combined entity would control **95-100% of U.S. iron ore production**
- Combined entity would control **65-90% of steel in U.S.-built automobiles**
- Combined entity would control **100% of electrical steel production in North America**
- Combined entity would represent **~50% of domestic flat steel market**

**Divestiture Requirements:**
- Milbank (legal advisors) estimated **$7B+ in revenue** would need to be divested
- This far exceeded Company D's $2B divestiture commitment
- Forced asset sales would occur at distressed prices

**Litigation Risk:**
- Timeline: Estimated **18+ months** of antitrust litigation
- Win Probability: Milbank advised Board this would be "a challenging case for the parties to win in litigation"
- DOJ/FTC likely to challenge in federal court even with proposed remedies

**Source:** *Schedule 14A Proxy Statement, page 43: "Representatives of Milbank advised the Board of Directors that, even if divestitures were offered that were aimed at addressing antitrust concerns, considerable risk remained that the U.S. Department of Justice would not accept those divestitures and would challenge the proposed acquisition of USS by Company D in court. Representatives of Milbank explained to the Board of Directors that this would be a challenging case for the parties to win in litigation."*

#### 2. Stock Consideration Volatility Risk

**Value Erosion During Regulatory Review:**
- Stock component ($27.00) subject to 18+ months of market volatility
- Company D stock would likely decline during extended antitrust litigation
- Potential divestitures would materially impact Company D's stock valuation
- No collar or protection mechanism in the offer

**Board Assessment:**
- Board discussed "potential impact resulting from divestitures that may be needed to obtain antitrust approvals on the value of Company D's common stock"
- Directed financial advisors to "seek an increase in the cash consideration, and a reduction in the quantum of Company D's common stock"

**Source:** *Schedule 14A Proxy Statement, page 43*

#### 3. Execution Uncertainty

**Stockholder Approval Risk:**
- Company D's stockholders must approve the transaction
- Added execution risk and potential for deal failure
- Extended timeline for approval process

**Contrast with NSC:**
- NSC offer required **no NSC stockholder approval** (100% funded by Nippon Steel)
- Provided superior execution certainty

**Source:** *Schedule 14A Proxy Statement, page 45*

#### 4. Value Destruction from Forced Divestitures

**Asset Sale Concerns:**
- $7B+ in revenue divestitures would need to be sold quickly
- Sales would occur at distressed/fire-sale prices
- Strategic value would be destroyed
- Integration complexity with remaining assets

**Impact on Stockholder Value:**
- Each dollar of divested revenue at distressed prices reduces combined company value
- Stock component of consideration would decline proportionally
- Actual realized value likely significantly below $54 nominal offer

## The Antitrust "Smoking Gun": Evidence Company D is Cleveland-Cliffs

### Market Concentration Analysis

**Combined USS + Cleveland-Cliffs Would Control:**

1. **Blast Furnace Production:** 100% of U.S. capacity
   - Cleveland-Cliffs: Largest remaining integrated producer
   - U.S. Steel: Second-largest integrated producer
   - Combined: Complete monopoly on blast furnace steel

2. **Iron Ore Production:** 95-100% of U.S. production
   - Cleveland-Cliffs: 25.4% market share (largest U.S. iron ore producer)
   - U.S. Steel: 30.4% market share (largest U.S. iron ore producer)
   - Combined: Near-total control of domestic iron ore

3. **Automotive Steel:** 65-90% of steel in U.S.-built automobiles
   - Both are top-2 suppliers to U.S. auto industry
   - Would eliminate competition for critical auto-grade steel

4. **Specialty Steel:** 100% of electrical steel production in North America
   - Would eliminate sole new competitor in non-grain-oriented steel

### Alliance for Automotive Innovation Opposition

**October 31, 2024 Letter to Congress:**
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation (representing major auto manufacturers) sent a letter expressing antitrust concerns about a Cleveland-Cliffs/USS combination, warning it would control:
- **100%** of blast furnace production
- **90%+** of advanced high-strength steel
- **80%** of body-in-white steel
- **65%** of exposed grade steel

This letter was publicly reported as being sent in opposition to **Cleveland-Cliffs**, not any other bidder.

**Source:** *Project knowledge document: "When America's Steel Giant Met Japan's Manufacturing Powerhouse"*

### United Steelworkers (USW) Endorsement

**August 17, 2023:** USW publicly assigned its contractual "right to bid" to **Cleveland-Cliffs**, effectively endorsing Cleveland-Cliffs as its preferred buyer over all other bidders.

This public endorsement aligns perfectly with "Company D" being the USW's preferred bidder throughout the proxy statement narrative.

**Source:** *Project knowledge documents*

### Post-Merger Litigation

**January 6, 2025 Lawsuit:**
U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel filed lawsuit against:

## The Irony: Cleveland-Cliffs' Subsequent Financial Struggles

### Post-Rejection Performance

Cleveland-Cliffs, the company that fought hardest to block the Nippon Steel-U.S. Steel merger, has experienced significant financial challenges in 2024-2025:

**Financial Results:**
- 2024: **-$708 million net loss** on $19.2B revenue
- 2025: **-$193.1 million net loss** on $17.0B revenue
- Described operating environment as "weakest steel demand since 2010 (excluding COVID)"

**Strategic Response:**
- Idled Dearborn, Michigan plant (March 2025)
- Acquired Stelco for $2.5B (November 2024) - adding more capacity in challenging market
- Prioritizing share buybacks over organic growth investments

**Contrast with U.S. Steel Under Nippon Ownership:**
- U.S. Steel secured $11-14 billion in committed capital investments from Nippon
- Major facility modernizations underway (Mon Valley, Gary Works)
- Technology transfer from Nippon's R&D capabilities
- Access to global markets and supply chains

**The Bottom Line:**
The company that claimed it could deliver superior value to USS shareholders and stakeholders is now struggling financially, while USS under Nippon ownership has massive investment commitments and strategic support.
